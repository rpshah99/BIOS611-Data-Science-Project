0,96444,"The participant began their experience by taking an unspecified substance that provided a dissociative state lasting several hours. During this time, they felt relaxed and experienced colorful visuals when closing their eyes. After about three hours, they decided to try another substance known for causing intense visual hallucinations. They smoked a mixture of this second substance with some cannabis.

The initial effects were overwhelming, with the participant feeling an energy flow through their body and seeing a black grid that morphed into various shapes and colors, primarily pink and green. The environment felt ancient yet futuristic, evoking imagery reminiscent of a 1950s soda shop but more mystical. As the experience progressed, the participant accepted this new reality as pleasant and natural.

Suddenly, music from ""I Am the Walrus"" by The Beatles began playing in the background, shattering the visual grid into colorful shards. From these shards emerged brief outlines of what appeared to be people. After a few minutes, the participant returned to their room, still highly affected but no longer in hyperspace. They called friends and expressed excitement about the experience.

The effects lasted for several more hours, with the participant feeling recharged and alive. The next day, they felt wobbly from the first substance but were eager to discuss the event. Since then, they have been hesitant to repeat the intense experience but have shared the remaining substance with friends."
1,62835,"The participant experienced several sessions involving a substance that produced vivid visual effects and altered states of consciousness. During early sessions, they saw images such as playing cards, skulls, military hardware, and screws. In one session, while in the kitchen, they observed their appliances displaying neon-colored patterns and exchanging pulses of energy between them.

In another session, after using an improved vaporizer, the participant entered a warm, womb-like state with some extra visual patterning. They then experienced a brief vision of rows of parked cars or an orderly residential scene from the 1950s, which they found startling and thought might be evidence of parallel universes.

In subsequent sessions, the participant encountered entities described as having Inca or Aztec architectural influence combined with opulent features like a wedding cake. These entities could rotate, twist, and shuffle like a Rubik's cube. The entity was surrounded by an amniotic sack that changed color from blue to green. Through one of its crystal surfaces, the participant glimpsed scenes resembling 1950s suburban streets.

The overall experience included feelings of well-being, heightened empathy, and a sense of spiritual connection."
2,34866,"The experience began in a room where nine people, including the narrator, took doses of Pharmahuasca (a combination of harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT). After ingesting the substances, some participants started chanting or moaning. The narrator felt queasy and nervous but focused on their breathing to calm themselves.

As the effects intensified, the narrator experienced waves of nausea and a deep sense of disassociation from their body. They described feeling as if they were sinking through the earth and losing connection with reality. During this phase, some participants vomited or left the room to do so.

The narrator then had an intense experience where they felt like they were dying repeatedly in waves, each time becoming more detached from physical reality. The entity guiding them (referred to as ""she"") communicated telepathically and tried to calm the narrator, explaining that death was beautiful. The narrator struggled with this experience, feeling a mix of fear and profound insight.

When the narrator's awareness returned partially, they felt alienated from their body and surroundings but experienced heightened empathy for others. They stumbled outside where plants seemed alive and sentient, communicating with them on an emotional level.

Back inside, the narrator had intense waves of emotion and physical exertion, repeatedly yelling ""PLEASE"" as if begging for help or release. The group formed a circle around the narrator, trying to comfort and support them. One participant (the leader) stood firm, helping the narrator maintain connection with reality while encouraging them to feel their own power.

After several hours, the narrator's experience began to subside. They felt calm and peaceful, blessing everything they saw as they walked around a rock garden outside. Another participant had a violent reaction during this time but was eventually calmed down by the leader.

The next day, another participant provided an alternative account of the night, describing it from their perspective and mentioning that some participants experienced severe nausea and physical discomfort."
3,113133,"The participant inhaled an unknown amount of the substance through a homemade smoking device. They experienced visual distortions, including neon colors assigned to sounds and geometric patterns like red and purple triangles. The environment transformed into a bioluminescent disco-like space with surreal geometry. The participant then felt as if they were traveling at high speed through various lounge-like rooms, each chamber displaying vibrant colors and complex patterns.

In one of these chambers, the participant encountered an entity resembling J, who wore a puffy top hat and communicated the word ""right?!"" to them. After this encounter, the participant experienced a sense of being in a singularity before returning to their human existence. Upon regaining consciousness, they found themselves in a room with green geometric fragments that throbbed and swayed. The walls heaved and sagged, and J's face appeared as an inquisitive treble clef.

The experience left the participant feeling fascinated and grateful for their return to normalcy. They felt a deep connection to objects around them, such as a laptop computer. After the trip, they experienced brief reoccurrences of DMT-like visuals during sleep and developed a meditation practice. A month later, while smoking marijuana, they had another intense visual experience with tunnel-like scenes and morphing imagery."
4,103790,"The participant began their day feeling energized and went to a friend's house in the afternoon for a psychedelic experience involving two substances. They consumed a decoction made from ground Syrian Rue, which produced visual distortions such as clouds being sucked into focused points of sky and enhanced body awareness. The individual also experienced a drunk-like sensation with impaired motor function.

After consuming the first substance, they went on a walk and then returned home to meditate. During meditation, they noticed surreal body awareness, including twitching sensations that were actually minor bodily functions becoming more apparent. They played a didgeridoo while their friend channeled breath into them, experiencing strange sensations flowing through their arms.

Nausea set in later, prompting the decision not to consume the second substance initially. However, after lying down and napping, they felt revitalized enough to proceed with the DMT experience. The DMT onset was intense, causing fractalization of reality where everything would break apart into nothingness and then reassemble repeatedly.

The participant experienced fear and panic during this process, struggling to maintain coherent thought or perception. They crawled over to their friend for comfort, who helped them through by repeating phrases like ""breath in love, exhale gratitude."" After a while, the intensity lessened, allowing the individual to regain some awareness of their body and surroundings.

They spoke with their girlfriend on the phone, expressing profound philosophical insights about the nature of existence and consciousness. The experience lasted approximately 1.5 hours before the DMT effects began to subside. In the aftermath, they felt a sense of enlightenment and gratitude for those around them, though still somewhat in shock from the intensity of the trip."
5,96614,"The participant prepared for a psychedelic experience in their backyard, setting up a comfortable environment with incense and a hammock. After an initial attempt that produced only mild effects, they decided to try again with a larger dose of the substance. This time, the guide's presence was requested and both went outside to the prepared area.

Upon inhaling the vaporized substance, the participant experienced a disintegration of their body and mind into a state described as emptiness or clear light. This state lasted for approximately 10 minutes according to the guide. As they fell out of this state, they recognized it as divine bliss and had philosophical realizations about the purpose of life and spiritual cultivation.

The experience then shifted to a sea of imagery representing their current life, followed by turbulence as the psyche began to reconstruct itself. The participant felt a connection with their biological mother and experienced being reborn in a womb-like state. They wept with joy and gratitude upon returning to familiar reality.

Afterwards, they expressed appreciation for the guide's presence during the experience and fell into a peaceful sleep."
6,101485,"In a series of trips, the participant encountered various entities and environments. In one experience, three tall, slender beings presented an object with a glowing light. Another encounter involved reptilian-like beings placing containers in the ground and leaving behind a small entity expressing loneliness. A business-like atmosphere was experienced with human colleagues, while another trip featured colorful elf-like creatures with interchangeable body parts.

The participant also had experiences involving intense emotions such as fear and grief, receiving messages about world events and personal loss. In one instance, they felt like they were reliving their entire life simultaneously in a dreamlike state. Another experience involved a maze-like path and synesthetic sensations where physical actions changed the surroundings.

Encounters with entities ranged from angry presences questioning human awareness to benevolent healers offering food or merging with the participant's body. The participant also experienced symbolic interactions, such as being given objects or fed substances that were meant to be taken back into reality.

The trips often involved vivid visual and sensory experiences, sometimes combined with other substances like LSD or ketamine, leading to complex and layered encounters in a perceived alternate reality."
7,101541,"The participant began their journey by drinking mushroom tea, followed by smoking caapi leaves mixed with weed. They then smoked three bowls of this mixture, experiencing a gradual increase in effects. The visual effect included shapes forming out of empty space, breaking apart and tumbling towards the participant on either side. This effect persisted throughout the experience.

The participant entered an altered state characterized by blissfulness, trance-like states, and loss of self. They communicated with various entities that provided advice and insights into personal life choices and future events. The astral plane was described as perfectly crafted and accepting.

After smoking DMT mixed with caapi leaves, the participant experienced intense visualizations where beings inhabited every piece of furniture and empty space in the room. These visuals were accompanied by a strong sense of bliss and an urge to keep eyes open despite wanting to close them.

The participant then moved outside, revisiting plant spirits and experiencing chess-themed visuals. They smoked another bowl with DMT and experienced fear, seeing decay and rebirth cycles in nature. An entity warned about a 'danger zone' in the yard, advising caution against negative energy.

After this fearful moment, the blissful state returned. The participant took a walk to the park, feeling elevated sensory abilities and intense awareness of others' energies. They felt like a fly on the wall, hearing distant conversations clearly. Upon returning home, they fell into a deep sleep.

Throughout the experience, the participant noted enhanced visual effects, spiritual ecstasy, and dreamlike states due to the combination of substances used."
8,93315,"Donovan, a spiritual individual interested in altered states of consciousness, experienced intense visual and auditory effects after inhaling a substance. Initially, he felt overwhelmed by neon streaks of electromagnetism around objects and then witnessed the room transform into an enormous dome filled with prisms resembling diamond eyeballs. He perceived himself as both inside and outside this ""museum"" simultaneously.

In the dome, Donovan encountered a two-dimensional man who resembled Two-Face from Batman, manipulating pulleys and levers. This figure was seen as the curator of the museum. The rules governing reality seemed to shift rapidly, causing confusion and disorientation. Donovan also experienced a sense of identity confusion, questioning his true self and relationship with others.

Later in the experience, he found himself back in the living room, feeling a current of electricity throughout the space. He then moved to the bathroom where he felt a strong sense of nostalgia and déjà vu. After vomiting, he returned to the living room more lucid but still experiencing altered perceptions.

The next day, Donovan consumed mushrooms with his brother Boob, leading to further hallucinations. The walls appeared like an aquarium, objects floated on a tide, and there was a feeling of eternal unity between him and Boob. A voice urged him to get up, initially seeming motivational but then turning urgent as if trying to revive someone.

Donovan later took another hit of the substance with a friend, enhancing his trip but not significantly altering it beyond what he had already experienced. In a final attempt early the next morning, Donovan inhaled more of the substance after drinking wine. This time, he became a two-dimensional black and white zigzag pattern and felt watched by an unseen observer. He also dreamt vividly about his brother failing to relate his experiences over several days."
9,94429,"The experience began in a dimly lit room with soft music playing. After inhaling an unknown substance through a pipe, the participant immediately felt intense visual distortions and a loss of connection to reality. Objects around them appeared to vibrate rapidly and transform into intricate patterns. The participant's thoughts became disjointed, and they struggled to comprehend their surroundings.

As the experience progressed, the room transformed into what seemed like an artistic masterpiece, with objects arranged in perfect symmetry. The visuals became increasingly complex and overwhelming, leading to a sense of nausea. The participant then entered a state where they perceived themselves as pure consciousness, disconnected from their physical body. They experienced vivid scenes that felt more real than anything previously encountered.

The experience shifted into a bright, white light, which the participant interpreted as a glimpse of a larger cosmic reality. They saw multiple universes and realized that all living beings were interconnected parts of a greater whole. The participant perceived themselves as a small part of an infinite entity, experiencing life from various perspectives simultaneously.

As the effects began to wane, the participant felt a profound sense of clarity and purpose. Upon regaining physical awareness, they expressed excitement and gratitude for the experience. They immediately stood up and left the room, feeling a strong desire for water. The after-effects lasted several hours, during which the participant felt an enhanced appreciation for life and a newfound self-awareness."
10,93145,"The participant took multiple small doses of a substance over several hours in a converted garage room equipped for relaxation and entertainment. After the first dose, they experienced heightened senses but no overt visual effects (OEVs) or complex visual effects (CEVs). By the second dose, slight OEVs were noted, similar to those from other substances like LSD-25 and 4-HO-DMT. The third oral dose increased stimulation and euphoria.

At around four hours in, after an intranasal dose, CEVs became more pronounced with vibrant colors and patterns. The participant felt a rush of euphoria and excitement, likened to combining MDMA and LSD-25. They experienced a peak where reality seemed altered, described as being suspended in space with friends nearby.

The experience included moments of discomfort, such as an ""ugly side"" that felt like being pulled into a cold burning environment. The participant managed to escape this feeling by opening their eyes. After returning to the garage, they consumed more marijuana and experienced a warm opiate-like buzz.

Later, outside in the street, visual effects continued with wiggling and stretching of surroundings. They decided to return home but felt too high to walk alone, so went back to the group. At home, residual OEVs made cartoons unsettling, but movies were enjoyable. The participant fell asleep with their cat and had vivid dreams.

The next day, they felt light and happier than usual without a headache. Physical effects included constricted veins when dehydrated, which reversed upon rehydration."
11,86665,"The individual sat on a beach near a music festival stage and smoked a substance from a pipe. About 5 seconds after laying back, they noticed a film-like substance covering their vision, resembling parameciums. A warm numbness spread down their face and throat as their heart rate increased.

They became aware of fractal patterns spinning downward from the sky, with thin lines containing small moving elements. The space between these lines darkened and pulsed with a sickly purple color, representing fear. They heard an audible message: ""You have taken a powerful psychedelic,"" which was simultaneously seen on a bright white banner.

The participant then encountered spherical green heads emerging from the fractal surface, resembling dancing figures from a children's show. These green men communicated joyfully and welcomed the individual to their realm. Occasionally, angry purple heads would emerge, expressing distressing messages, but were quickly removed by the green men.

An insight was presented through multiple mediums: the images before them represented the continuous movement of creation towards higher consciousness. The green men demonstrated this concept by transforming into various objects and back again. They showed snapshots from the individual's life, emphasizing that these events are merely reflections of a formless reality based on vibration.

The concepts of separation and duality were depicted as billboards and discarded. The insight was celebrated with joyous exclamations from the green men. They then donned graduation attire and presented a certificate to the individual before returning to work.

As the experience concluded, the spiral tunnel began to slow and thin out, allowing the clouds and sky to reappear faintly behind the vision. The participant returned to their body after approximately 15 minutes, feeling euphoric and connected to the beauty of reality."
12,83719,"The participant smoked a small dose of DMT alone in their apartment. They experienced a strong buzzing sensation around the nose and sinuses upon inhalation. As they came up, they felt intense pleasure from diamond-shaped crystals forming and dissolving on their mucous membranes. The sounds were distorted as if electronically stretched.

At peak, the participant saw their childhood home at night with red, green, and gold colors. They also observed a turtle tank in front of them, where Hiram (the turtle) dove from the surface to eye level directly in front of them multiple times. The participant felt a strong sense of homecoming and gratitude towards Hiram.

The visuals included fractal-like patterns on surfaces and calculus equations swimming on all objects. They experienced a feeling of existing in two worlds simultaneously, with one being their childhood home and another being their current apartment. The experience was accompanied by an internal music that sounded like Howard Shore's ""Shire Theme"" from Lord of the Rings but infinitely more complex.

The participant came down gradually, noticing tunnel vision effects and calculus equations on surfaces. They felt a sense of relief upon returning to baseline and found everything in their apartment seemed amazing and new again."
13,31979,"During an intense experience, the participant encountered numerous oscillating entities that appeared to act independently of their thoughts. These entities were perceived as complex and infinite in nature. Each finger was connected to a spirit, allowing the participant to control thousands of fingers simultaneously, creating a sensation of conducting an orchestra with millions of participants.

The environment seemed to merge sound and sight, enhancing the sensory experience. The participant eventually found themselves in absolute nothingness, encountering one final entity that oscillated rapidly, leading to a conversation about identity at an accelerated pace. This culminated in the perception of becoming the color blue, symbolizing a frequency.

The spirit then presented a gift and asked what was their favorite hue before rushing away while laughing. Upon opening their eyes, the participant found themselves looking directly at a clear blue sky outside the window. The experience left them with a sense of awe but also caution about repeating it due to its intensity."
14,1841,"The individual began their experience by smoking a pipe filled with an unknown substance. Initially, they felt a sense of dropping away and experienced visual architectonic dream waters and auditory sensations. Around them, they sensed the presence of beings similar to Celtic Faeries but did not see these creatures clearly. The participant then entered a state where intricate crystalline worlds were exfoliating from every nook and cranny in their spacetime.

After about a minute, the individual felt a shockwave across the dome of the sky, which gave them memory of the real world. They began an ""extrication"" process to return to reality by opening their eyes. Upon returning, they observed that the woman handling the pipe looked like a fractal Medusa with buzzing energy.

The participant then attempted to visualize in every direction at once and succeeded in imagining themselves within a superspace filled with stars and dragonfly constellations. They encountered entities described as elves or aliens who communicated through self-dribbling jeweled basketballs and other surreal objects. These beings engaged the individual in games of catch, synthesizing and re-synthesizing categories of mind into hyperdimensional objects.

As alarms went off, the space began to quiver with high-energy dynamics as the entities tried to get the participant out of hyperspace. The experience concluded with a series of farewells and goodbyes, described as jeweled great glass revolving elevators all the way down. Upon opening their eyes, the individual experienced slight tracers on light before returning fully to reality."
15,1839,"The individual experienced a highly vivid and colorful visual environment after entering what they perceived as another realm. They saw two figures, described as simple balloon-like computer-generated images, who greeted them warmly and spoke to them about their significance in this new world. The figures referred to the participant as ""the big winner"" and ""The One,"" indicating that they had been chosen for a special purpose.

As the experience progressed, the individual was shown various life experiences through a flood of images and emotions, which were presented as clues leading up to this moment. They felt a sense of relief, excitement, and fear as these revelations unfolded. The figures led them deeper into their world, where they encountered an hourglass-like object that symbolized a transformation process.

The participant perceived themselves as becoming more perceptive and godlike but also realized that this new state might come at the cost of their physical life. They felt chosen to bear this burden and experienced a moment of panic when they believed they were transitioning into this new existence permanently.

Returning to reality, the individual continued to experience vivid hallucinations, seeing surfaces as if covered in moving film and perceiving symbolic patterns. Friends sitting next to them appeared as layers of light, reinforcing their belief that these hallucinations were real. The participant expressed fear and a sense of being chosen for an exalted state but also felt overwhelmed by the potential consequences.

As the experience began to fade, the individual's friends helped bring them back to reality by reassuring them that the effects would wear off soon. They eventually regained control over their body and mind, drifting out of the hallucinatory realm with assistance from their companions."
16,117473,"The participant had three DMT experiences on the same day. The first two were less intense with brief visual landscapes and entities. In the third experience, after taking 22 mg, they entered a dark tunnel-like space before emerging into a layered, brown landscape filled with mechanical entities. These entities were described as boxlike, brightly colored, and radiating light. They communicated intensely but in an overwhelming manner, making it difficult for the participant to ask for help or engage meaningfully.

The experience then shifted to a more playful environment resembling a pastel-colored preschool with small entities, vehicles, and habitations. The participant felt moments of humor and acceptance during this phase. Upon returning to reality, they experienced difficulty in controlling their body movements and typing but gradually recovered. The next day, the participant felt calm yet oddly close to death, possibly due to biting their cheek during the experience."
17,115502,"The participant began their experience in a quiet bedroom at night, feeling excited yet slightly apprehensive about the outcome. They smoked a small amount of powder using the ""sandwich method"" and immediately felt intense visual effects characterized by bright fractals similar to Hindu designs. A light body load followed, leading them into an altered state.

In this new reality, they encountered a neutral entity described as a gatekeeper, which inspected them calmly without speaking. The participant then transitioned again, losing all sense of individuality and experiencing what felt like ego death. They existed in a peaceful, timeless state devoid of human thoughts or emotions, feeling content as an energetic part of a harmonious plane.

As the effects began to wear off, the participant returned to their human consciousness with a profound sense of loss and disappointment at leaving behind the blissful state. The transition back felt unnatural and jarring compared to the seamless shift into the altered reality."
18,99247,"The individual experienced an intense journey characterized by a sense of unity with the universe and all living beings. They felt their consciousness expanding beyond their physical body, connecting with friends in the room and others across time and space. The visuals included spiraling DNA helixes, vast cosmic landscapes, and shifting color palettes that reflected emotional states.

The participant interacted with an entity described as a multi-faced consciousness, which appeared in various forms such as trees and celestial beings. This entity communicated through facial expressions and actions, sometimes appearing condescending or pitiful, and at other times serious and solemn. The individual also perceived this entity as the creator of the universe, guiding them through blockages and challenges.

Throughout the experience, there were moments of overwhelming ecstasy and euphoria, interspersed with periods of anxiety and concern about not fully understanding certain aspects of the journey. The participant felt a need to return to their physical body but struggled with the transition, eventually being ""smushed"" back into it by the guiding consciousness.

The trip included vivid flashbacks of past adventures and interactions with friends, as well as glimpses of what seemed like past lives or other people's experiences. Despite the intensity and complexity of the experience, the individual maintained a coherent awareness throughout."
19,108109,"The experience began with the participant laying on their couch, initially perceiving fractal visuals but still within what they considered reality. Suddenly, their body disintegrated into particles, and the room's walls expanded away. They briefly saw a vast purple dome-like structure covered in fractals before being ripped away upon attempting to speak. Following this, they encountered incomprehensible visuals including vertical white planes with black dots that closed in on them. Throughout these experiences, there was an overwhelming sound that continually grew louder.

The participant felt intense terror and believed they had died. They perceived a consciousness or entity in the environment, which seemed to enjoy their fear but did not appear malevolent. The non-participant struggled to grasp the concept of self, eventually uttering ""I"" repeatedly until recalling their name: ""A****** J*****"". This process took an extended period, though it felt like moments and eternity simultaneously.

The experience concluded with familiar objects in the apartment resolving themselves one by one, including a calendar on the wall. The participant regained awareness of their body and surroundings but remained confused for some time afterward."
20,112845,"The participant begins by inhaling vapor from a pipe, which triggers vivid visual patterns in their room. As they take more hits, the visuals become more complex and overwhelming. They feel disoriented and experience intense sensory overload, including tasting metallic pellets and seeing a jester-like face that appears and disappears.

In this altered state, the participant encounters four entities described as having an amorphous shape with auras around them. Two of these beings show less interest in the participant and move away to consume some substance through paraphernalia. The remaining two, identified as a male and female couple, engage more deeply with the participant.

The interaction between the participant and the couple is characterized by profound empathy and an unguarded sharing of their innermost selves. They communicate without words or hesitation, experiencing each other's essence fully. This leads to a state of blissful connection that contrasts sharply with the earlier anxiety and disorientation.

As the experience winds down, the participant feels a gentle return to reality but remains in awe of what they've experienced. Upon opening their eyes, they express gratitude and make a promise to cherish the memory of these encounters."
21,112640,"A participant underwent two study days at Imperial College London's Hammersmith Hospital as part of a neuroscience research project involving brain imaging. On each day, they were fitted with an EEG skullcap and placed in an MRI scanner for four sessions: two with the substance and two with placebo. The participant was injected intravenously with the substance or saline solution.

During the first dosing session, the participant experienced a rapid onset of visual effects characterized by geometric patterns of extraordinary beauty and order, including metallic colors like coppery bronze, navy blue, and neon pink. They also felt a warm energy in their hands. The experience was intense but brief, lasting only about three minutes. Upon returning to baseline, they reported feelings of serenity and gratitude.

In the second dosing session, with a higher dose, the participant encountered more expansive and fast-moving geometric patterns. This experience was described as both ordered and chaotic, imposing in tone compared to the first one. The MRI scanner's noise interacted with the visual aspect of the experience, making it difficult to distinguish between what they were hearing and seeing.

The participant remained still throughout both experiences, despite the confined space and loud noises from the MRI machine. They expressed a positive attitude towards the setting and felt that the scientific context did not detract from their experience."
22,111847,"The narrator, after inhaling DMT vaporized in a cannabis pipe, immediately found themselves in a different dimension characterized by an amorphous sphere emitting complex patterns and colors beyond visible light. Within this sphere were beings that reached out to the narrator, inviting them to follow. These beings wore masks and engaged in playful, sometimes silly behavior, such as one wearing a cat-like mask making exaggerated faces.

The narrator followed these beings into another realm described as an infinite hallway with shifting reds and blues covered in intricate geometry. This new place felt incredibly familiar, evoking memories of the inside of a womb or a spiritual concept like the Supersoul. The experience was serene and awe-inspiring, causing tears to stream down the narrator's face.

After about eight minutes, the DMT effects began to fade, leaving the narrator staring at their closed eyelids before opening them to see altered perceptions of clouds. Upon returning to reality, the narrator felt a sense of dullness compared to the profound experience just undergone and was moved to reflect on past traumas, particularly the death of a friend named Jack."
23,96140,"The participant had previous experience with various hallucinogens but was初次尝试DMT。他们在第一次尝试时使用了非常少量的剂量，大约5-10毫克，并在站立状态下吸入。他们感觉到轻微的头部变化和视觉振动，但没有完全突破阈值。接下来的一天，他们尝试了30毫克的剂量，在床上躺着吸食。这次体验中，他们经历了强烈的色彩漩涡和一个静止不动的形象——象头人身神Ganesh。尽管如此，他们仍然保持自我意识，并在20分钟后逐渐恢复。

为了更好地突破阈值，参与者研究了一种新的吸入方法：将DMT包裹在锡箔纸里，在烟斗中吸食自由基形式的DMT。这次尝试使用了40毫克的剂量。当他们开始吸食时，感觉到强烈的振动和视觉变化。突然间，他们感到快速下坠，并通过一个充满红色光线的隧道进入宇宙空间。在那里，他们听到了许多声音在重复说“欢迎你”。时间仿佛停滞，他们感觉自己与万物合一。重新获得意识后，参与者感到前所未有的喜悦。"
24,103249,"The experience began with a familiar crackling sound followed by intense visuals of a mandala wall. After piercing through this wall, the participant felt like they were parachuting downward into a peaceful state. During this time, there was an awareness of having a body and smelling something pungent and organic.

The wife entered the room and started playing Tabla, which took over as the primary focus. An entity then inhabited the participant's body to play along with the music by using their mouth to produce sounds that they could not have made on their own. This lasted for about 8-10 minutes before the entity left without a noticeable transition."
25,108821,"The participant inhaled a very small amount of a psychoactive substance through a vaporizer. Initially, they felt no noticeable effects but after a few minutes, experienced a sudden onset of profound sensations. They perceived intricate patterns and structures that resembled crystalline, organic forms with flowing energy and numerical digits in various colors.

Opening their eyes, the room appeared alien and slightly unsettling. The participant maintained a sense of lucidity throughout, narrating the experience to themselves. They felt a deep connection to the universe, understanding it as both familiar and vast. This led to reflections on the nature of time, space, and existence, including thoughts about how all energy might reunite.

The trip lasted approximately eight minutes, but the participant perceived it as much longer due to its intensity. Afterward, they felt buzzed and struggled to describe what they had seen, considering ""colors"" an inadequate term for the vivid imagery experienced."
26,91964,"The individual reported experiencing intense physical sensations including vibrations throughout the body and a heavy feeling that made movement difficult. The environment around them seemed to shimmer and melt away. Visual effects included swirling colors and rapidly changing fractal patterns. An entity appeared as a transparent sphere with an orange, pulsating life force inside. This sphere was being manipulated by a naked figure without clear gender characteristics, who appeared to be actively engaging with the sphere for the participant's benefit.

After the experience, the individual felt compelled to organize their surroundings and make sense of the chaotic data they had perceived during the trip."
27,90113,"The individual began their experience in a room with a friend, smoking from a bong filled with weed stems. Initially, they experienced geometric patterns of red and green colors swirling before their eyes as their awareness remained in the room but their eyes rolled back involuntarily. The participant felt a wrenching battle within themselves, which was alleviated by their friend's encouragement to let go.

After some time, the individual took another hit from the bong, leading to an intense experience characterized by rapidly building energy and a strong heartbeat. This energy reached the throat, causing involuntary deep breaths and tears of relief rather than sadness. The participant cried over past emotional pain, specifically mentioning a former lover who had broken their heart.

The friend expressed concern during this period, prompting further discussion about relationships and personal opinions. Upon coming down from the experience, the individual felt loved and at peace but also noticed fear beginning to resurface as the effects faded."
28,107582,"The participant and his friends prepared for their drug experience by setting up in the participant's home with a bong and changa. They took turns smoking changa through the bong, each hit causing varying degrees of visual and auditory hallucinations. The first hit caused tingling sensations and cold sweats, while the second hit intensified the visuals and sounds. During the third hit, the participant experienced intense visual patterns that formed a multi-dimensional room with fractal designs. He felt as if he was inside this room, where concepts like up or down did not apply. An alien entity appeared to him, describing the room's material as plastic-like but alive. The participant then returned to reality when the music changed, experiencing strong deja vu and intense visuals that left trails. Afterward, they listened to various albums and shared drinks and cigarettes."
29,97591,"The participant consumed a dose of an unknown substance and experienced vivid visuals immediately after inhalation. They saw colorful geometry that resolved into a pathway leading to a Mayan-themed pyramid. Upon reaching the top, they encountered an N-dimensional unicursal hexagram being which appeared annoyed by their questions about existence. The participant felt embarrassed and was pushed back down the steps, experiencing a sharp pain in the brain.

Next, they found themselves in a 'cosmic emergency room' where elfin nurses tended to them. These nurses communicated telepathically, expressing empathy towards the patients and criticizing the participant's arrogance. After treatment, a 'cosmic taxi mechanism' arrived to take the participant home. The nurses bid farewell in large numbers.

The effects were still strong 15 minutes later but had become more like an altered state of consciousness rather than intense visuals. The participant regained full awareness around 20 minutes post-consumption and was able to communicate with friends about their experience."
30,90557,"The individual began in a dark, unfamiliar state, feeling disconnected from their surroundings and identity. They were shown a room and recognized a friend sitting next to them. The experience was accompanied by visual distortions of green hexadecimal shapes. As they focused on music playing (""Justice Phantom II"" remix), they felt pulled towards an otherworldly dimension.

In this new space, the individual interacted with entities that appeared as matrix-like beings shaped by the same green hexagonal patterns. These entities communicated through a song-like voice and helped guide the person to understand complex concepts about reality, consciousness, and existence. The entities showed the participant glimpses of answers to questions before they were fully formed, emphasizing that these insights were already known but forgotten.

The experience included a visit to what was described as an ether or void, where the individual encountered beings who explained the nature of reality, time, space, and emotions. These explanations suggested that emotions exist in a different dimension from pure consciousness and that the participant's current reality is a projection created by their own mind.

After exploring these concepts, the entities gently guided the person back to their original reality, emphasizing that some knowledge could not be fully retained or described once returned. The individual experienced physical discomfort as they reconnected with their body in the room, but was eventually able to integrate back into normal consciousness after about an hour of the experience."
31,101998,"The participant had several intense psychedelic experiences over a period of time. Initially, they reported weak visual effects and some entity content but no direct interaction. As they continued to use the substance, their experiences became more vivid and included strong visual distortions such as breathing walls and layered visions filled with colorful static.

In one experience, the participant felt like their consciousness was at the center of a nebula-like structure with white light. They perceived a mesh of concepts and hallucinations that were dynamic and constantly changing but only partially visible. These hallucinations seemed separate from the participant's own consciousness and drew heavily from their subconscious memories. The psychological aspect included feelings of impending death, which were new for them.

As the experience progressed, the participant became aware of their body again and felt a strong urge to check their vitals. They experienced disorientation and spatial distortion but eventually turned on the light and saw multiple transparent copies of their bedroom breathing as one. This led to a sense of relief and happiness about being alive.

In another session, the participant had hypnagogic visions that were erotic in nature and included warping scenery such as buildings rising from the ground and transforming into alien spaceships. These visions felt like they existed in the environment rather than within the participant's mind.

The final experience involved intense synesthesia where breathing caused reality to warp into well-defined humanoid shapes, which were intrinsically linked to the participant's body. This was a new type of hallucination for them and differed from previous experiences with entity content.

Throughout these sessions, the participant reflected on their fears about pushing further into psychedelic use and how these trips helped alleviate those concerns."
32,83098,"The individual began the experience in a relaxed state after recovering from previous substance use. They snorted a large dose of a white powder and initially saw mild visual effects before encountering numerous beings that appeared to study them. These encounters were brief and overwhelming but not frightening.

Next, they experienced what felt like the creation of mankind, being trapped in a pink jelly-like material inside an alien environment. This was followed by interaction with an advanced extraterrestrial being who helped guide their awareness towards beneficial experiences and assisted in overcoming personal weaknesses. The being also shared insights about other beings existing among them without conflict.

The experience then shifted to what felt like the return of Jesus Christ, causing intense emotions as they feared judgment and eternal damnation. After this, the individual moved harmoniously with the music, engaging in repetitive motions that felt natural and therapeutic.

A demon-like entity attempted to possess the person, offering rewards for surrender but being resisted through an internal battle. The participant then experienced fear of death, feeling unworthy and rejected, which they combated by breathing deeply and moving their body to promote healing. They eventually regained a sense of calm as they awaited the end of the experience.

Upon standing up, the individual felt refreshed with large pupils and an optimistic outlook on life. The entire trip lasted about an hour according to observers, who noted its intensity compared to other DMT experiences."
33,94031,"The participant began their journey in a comfortable setting with friends, using an unidentified substance. They experienced perceptual changes after several inhalations, including altered lighting and geometric patterns. As the effects intensified, they reported feeling heavy and experiencing visual distortions such as seeing hundreds of fingers on each hand and feeling like they were sitting on a stage before millions of people.

Lying down, the participant felt themselves leave their body and enter a surreal environment where they flew through blackness and landed on what appeared to be a cloud. They encountered arches reminiscent of ancient architecture and walked towards an orchard with a distant city and a full moon that turned out to be a giant entity's face.

The participant then saw their mother and grandmother, both wearing white robes, who communicated non-verbally. They expressed urgency about the participant being ready for something but did not provide details. The participant was then brought into another scene where they were chained down in a grid-like structure with neon geometric shapes around them.

An entity appeared, described as warm and inviting despite its alien appearance. Through non-verbal communication, this entity conveyed love and reassurance before detaching the participant's right leg without causing pain. Colored vapors emerged from the detached limb, each color representing something negative that needed to be released from the participant's life.

After reattaching the leg, the participant was returned to their body feeling better than ever before, with a lasting sense of happiness for about a month following the experience."
34,94073,"The participant began their experience by consuming a substance that induced positive feelings and enhanced sensory perception. They then visited an Indian restaurant where they felt an increased interest in India and noticed flowing colors on the walls. Back at the apartment, they listened to music while preparing for another substance intake. The preparation involved smoking a mixture of tobacco and cannabis.

The participant then consumed DMT through their bong and experienced intense visual hallucinations and physical sensations. They saw vibrant patterns and felt as though they were flying through the universe, encountering complex data structures and eventually reaching a white light. Upon breaking through to another reality, they observed intricate color patterns and had profound realizations about life.

The participant encountered several entities with unusual appearances that communicated guidelines for maintaining positive energy and treating their body well. They also experienced a sense of not being alone in this reality and saw creatures emerging from the colors around them. The main entity provided advice on living positively, eating organically, and helping others more than oneself.

After returning to baseline consciousness, the participant observed another individual experiencing DMT-induced hallucinations, including an ""all-seeing eye"" appearing on their forehead before they vomited. The experience lasted approximately 90 seconds from the participant's perspective but felt much longer due to its intensity.

The night concluded with discussions about the experiences and lessons learned among the participants."
35,89351,"The participant began by taking 300 mg of a substance orally at T+0:00, followed by smoking a joint containing another substance at T+0:30. At T+2:00, the participant chewed and held six leaves of Coleus pumilas in their mouth, experiencing a mild, dreamy state that included brief periods of reality-flipping. Around T+3:30, they placed one hit of a substance under their tongue. By T+6:30, they smoked hash, and at T+7:00, vaporized a small amount of another substance.

During the experience, the participant engaged in conversations with several individuals, including Jess, Nessie, Eliane, and Lana. They felt open-hearted and experienced strong emotional connections, particularly with Jess and Eliane. The participant also provided support to Lana when she was distressed.

The visual effects included complex imagery formed by music, such as a long scaly reptilian beast crawling over a barrier while pulling the participant along. There were moments of introspection and synaesthesia, where sounds created vivid visual and physical sensations. The participant experienced reality-flipping effects induced by Coleus pumilas.

The experience concluded with watching South Park cartoons at T+8:00, and the afterglow lasted for about 36 hours, during which time the participant felt blissed out and enthusiastic, engaging in conversations on various topics including psychedelics, love, and philosophy."
36,93223,"The participant began their journey by inhaling vapor from a pipe containing a substance. Within seconds, they noticed colors around them blending together in gradients, creating a watercolor or stained glass effect. They also heard a mechanical sound that modulated in frequency before fading away.

Closing their eyes, the participant experienced an expansive visual field stretching infinitely in all directions. The vision was filled with deep purple and shimmering blue and green fractal patterns that reacted to their thoughts, movements, and breaths. These patterns resembled a hypercube and were constantly morphing into intricate geometries.

A human-like figure appeared near what the participant considered the top of this visual field. This multi-armed female entity matched the colors around her and seemed to control the intricate vision. The participant felt a sense of awe and connection with this figure.

As the experience began to wane, the participant noticed a warm sensation on their face, which they directed towards their third eye. This led to an intense moment of euphoria as if a beam of light had merged through their skin into their third eye.

Opening their eyes, the participant observed spinning shadows and intricate patterns on the wall in front of them. A white splotch on the wall caught their attention, appearing to dilate like a pupil with various colors hovering around it. The participant stared at this for an extended period before feeling a need to drink due to discomfort in their throat.

The experience left the participant with a sense of déjà vu and profound insights into consciousness and creation myths."
37,91352,"The individual took an unspecified substance orally at 11:55 PM and began experiencing effects around 12:35 AM. Early on, they felt walls breathing slightly and experienced tingling sensations. By 1:09 AM, the participant reported feeling like an alien while looking at themselves through a crystallized wall as a hybrid between a cockroach and human.

At 1:32 AM, closed-eye visuals were described as a vortex of glowing arrows leading to an intense light show. Around this time, they also experienced nausea and smoked cannabis for relief. By 1:47 AM, the participant encountered the death state, feeling confused but not terrified due to philosophical realizations about existence.

From 2:30 AM onwards, the individual had profound thoughts on life, love, and unity, believing everything is one and that they were part of an infinite intelligence. They felt their life was ending at times but also realized it was a temporary state brought on by the substance.

At 4:03 AM, after attempting to smoke another substance (which vaporized poorly), they experienced out-of-body visions with two children in a geometric playground. The visuals were clear and distinct from the psychedelic effects of the first substance.

By 5:20 AM, the participant played Assassin's Creed, noting that Ezio was acting insane and tripping balls while killing people. They could see intricate details in the game graphics that they couldn't easily find sober.

The experience gradually diminished by 7:00 AM, allowing the individual to sleep. Aftereffects included sluggishness and minor typing errors for a day or two."
38,94174,"The participant began the experience feeling intense discomfort from inhaling a substance, followed by a buildup of energy in their body and changes in visual perception, including brighter colors and vibrating objects. Closing their eyes led to an initial hallucination resembling an anemone or writhing worms. This then transformed into a vivid scene with warm-colored walls that subtly changed pattern.

In this scene, the participant was seated at a table facing a humanoid being with a horse-like head and tentacles where its mouth would be. The being offered the participant an object created through a process of exhalation or singing. Other similar beings were present around the table, each receiving their own object from the central figure.

The entities did not interact directly with the participant but continued their activity without noticing them. The participant wondered if they might have been occupying someone else's body due to simultaneous psychedelic use. After some time, a vibration brought the participant back to reality, where they found themselves in the same physical state as before the experience, which had lasted only a few minutes subjectively."
39,86537,"The individual began their experience in a prepared space with ambient sounds playing softly in the background. After consuming several hits of an unknown substance, they entered into a state characterized by vivid colors, fluid forms, and a sense of interconnectedness. The environment around them transformed, with objects like a cello taking on impossible geometries and emitting vibrant light and sound.

As the experience intensified, the participant encountered various entities. One entity appeared as a humanoid figure made of pure light and unconditional love, which communicated through touch and conveyed a message of peace. Another set of beings were described as gentle, loving arms that enveloped the individual and transported them to a place where multiple dimensions were laid out for examination.

The experience included moments of deep introspection and encounters with entities that seemed to communicate profound messages. The participant felt a sense of enlightenment and an understanding that there is something greater beyond their current existence. Upon returning to normal consciousness, they reported vivid visual and conceptual experiences lasting about 20 minutes, leaving them with a realization about the nature of reality and mortality."
40,92625,"The participant experienced two intense episodes with a substance that caused vivid visual and auditory hallucinations. During the first episode, they felt their body glow with warmth after inhaling the substance three times. They saw rapidly moving geometric patterns and colors, which resembled cartoon-like visuals. The participant also briefly perceived visions of flying over a highway led by a ghostly entity and saw their own still body as if dead. Time seemed to lose meaning during this experience.

After about 3.5 minutes, the initial rush subsided into a glow with more manageable geometric patterns. Open-eyed visuals remained strong but less overwhelming. The participant felt mentally exhausted afterward and experienced physical discomfort in their back.

In the second episode, initiated by taking three quick hits of the substance again, they were immediately transported to an alternate realm characterized by intense electrical sensations and deeper, more complex visual hallucinations. They perceived a structure similar to something from a Dr. Seuss book that was constantly being built and destroyed while folding in and out of itself across infinite dimensions. The colors were predominantly green and purple.

The participant briefly saw a small, box-like entity riding this structure as if it were a wave. After about 4 minutes, the experience ended abruptly, leaving them with an intense afterglow. They felt blissful and more sober than usual, maintaining this state for several hours afterward."
41,93030,"The individual began their experience by inhaling the substance from a pipe, noting immediate effects that caused disorientation and fear. They lay down on a bed, observing a red/yellow pattern transform into an expansive, kaleidoscopic ceiling. The participant heard a loud ringing sound which they later perceived as a living entity communicating with them.

This entity guided the individual through their experience, initially causing the visual field to dissolve into blackness before reintroducing vivid colors and patterns. A face formed from these colors, speaking briefly before being interrupted by external noise. The participant then observed moving shadows on the ceiling and a spinning ball hanging from it.

The experience concluded with the return of normal vision and surroundings, though the individual remained in a heightened state for some time afterward. They expressed amazement at the intensity and duration of their trip, noting that they felt rushed due to interruptions by friends."
42,90577,"The participant began their experience after smoking DMT following a routine that included cannabis and herbal tea. They experienced visual distortions as they inhaled the substance. The tunnels leading to the main experience were longer than usual and featured imagery related to human sexuality, including both feminine and male forms without any explicit penetration scenes.

Upon breaking through, the participant encountered an entity described as powerful but not of significant importance to humans. This being requested oral sex from the participant, who complied naturally within the DMT state. The encounter was brief, after which the participant perceived a physical barrier between themselves and other entities they typically interact with during such experiences. The barrier had intricate geometric patterns and seemed neutral rather than negative.

The participant then crossed this barrier and greeted familiar elves, who were excited to see them. They engaged in vocalizing objects into existence, creating a group of intertwined mushrooms. As the experience began to fade, the participant bid farewell to the entities and received warm goodbyes in return. The final impression left by one entity was that it resided within everyone."
43,95155,"The participant began the trip by smoking DMT while his girlfriend performed oral sex on him. He first entered a ""DMT waiting room"" with green walls and gold patterns, where he saw benevolent entities dancing around. Despite the heightened pleasure from the act of oral sex, he found it difficult to break through initially but managed to do so after focusing his breathing.

In the next phase, he sat before an other-worldly staircase and observed various figures passing by, including aliens on bicycles and young alien girls riding them. He then became aware of two entities engaging in intercourse above him, enclosed in a pod-like structure with a sheen of light indicating a barrier between them. The male entity had a blacked-out face, while the female was curvaceous with chrome-like skin.

The environment shifted again to an alien hostel where he witnessed an orgy involving cyborg aliens and biological entities engaging in various sexual acts. After about 7 minutes, the DMT concentration in his brain decreased, and he became aware of his girlfriend once more. He maintained a vigorous erection throughout the entire experience."
44,93105,"The participant and a friend smoked an unknown substance in an abandoned house around 11pm. Initially, the participant felt anxious but determined to proceed. They experienced intense auditory sensations from slight movements, such as the sound of their leather jacket. A strong sense of detachment from their body set in, making them feel like they were losing control and battling with their sanity.

The participant encountered two or possibly three faceless, round-headed entities that communicated telepathically. These beings provided an answer to a profound question, which the user could not remember upon returning to reality. The experience culminated in a state of oneness with everything before gradually coming back to reality."
45,92678,"The experience began after inhaling a substance from a bowl containing crystals. The participant felt a rapid onset of effects characterized by intense visual and auditory hallucinations. They saw fractal patterns forming a vortex-like portal above them, which they could not determine if it was inside their mind or in the external environment.

As the trip progressed, the participant's friend appeared as an aboriginal man with swirling rainbow colors around his face, while another individual appeared with only white eyes visible. These entities communicated telepathically and responded to the participant's physical movements, suggesting a connection between actions and information received.

The participant felt as if they were part of a vast interconnected web of life, where every action had an effect on the environment. They experienced themselves as an electric wire connecting all existence, including planets and stars. With focused intention, they imagined driving the planet through space at high speeds, conveying a message about the potential for human influence on planetary movement.

The experience concluded abruptly after approximately 15 minutes, leaving the participant with a sense of having received extensive information about life and existence."
46,89948,"Three individuals (Red, Black, and Blue) began their experience at a beach location after consuming cactus extract containing mescaline. They initially felt mild effects such as light-headedness and numbness but continued to feel detached from their surroundings as they walked along the sand towards a distant cliff. The walk seemed longer than expected due to the altered perception of time.

Upon reaching the cliff, they found an optimal spot overlooking the ocean where they prepared to consume DMT and cannabis. Red went first, experiencing intense visual effects including fractals and patterns in the horizon. He felt bombarded with insights about life and death, leading to a sense of humor and emotional release. Black followed, reporting vivid imagery such as dolphins jumping and cliffs transforming into animals while listening to Pink Floyd's ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond."" The sun appeared to explode, creating an overwhelming spiritual experience.

Blue then took his turn with DMT, experiencing fractals in the distance and a strong urge to move towards the setting sun. He reflected deeply on life choices and felt humbled by the vastness of existence. After their experiences, they walked back to their car in silence, feeling detached from reality due to the combined effects of mescaline and DMT.

In the car, they listened to Led Zeppelin's music, which intensified their euphoria. Blue drove them to a Subway restaurant where they ate silently while observing the surroundings. The return journey felt surreal, with time perception distorted. They arrived home feeling drained but peaceful.

The following days were marked by fatigue and introspection as they processed the profound experience of combining mescaline, DMT, and cannabis in a natural setting."
47,86649,"The participant began their experience in a living room setting. Upon inhaling the substance, they experienced fractal patterns and vivid colors that seemed to have intent and were not random. They felt observed by an intelligent presence assessing their senses. The participant reported crying out of relief at realizing they had never been alone.

Visuals included dancing lights and shapes leading their gaze to a swirling display on the ceiling. Sound and light appeared interconnected, with sound giving birth to light or vice versa. The participant's body seemed to vibrate and fly through the room in response to these sensations.

Closing their eyes revealed deeper colors and shapes, leading them into another realm where smiley faces attracted their attention. Creatures formed from dense matter began appearing, initially resembling something from a movie but eventually taking more comprehensible forms. These beings were referred to as ""overlords"" by the participant.

The ""overlords"" communicated with the participant, explaining that the world's state is just one of many and will be alright in the end. Subsequent experiences allowed the participant to continue exploring these realms, sometimes for fun or to get closer to a central light source within each trip.

In these experiences, the participant claimed to have developed abilities such as manifesting items from nothing, elevating at will, shifting realities, and telepathically communicating with distant friends. They also reported identifying fault lines in existence like jealousy, fear, and hate, which they believed could be manipulated and extinguished.

The ""overlords"" conveyed a message about an impending change leading to paradise, emphasizing love, compassion, and mercy as key vibrations for this transformation."
48,86830,"The participant began by inhaling a substance through a pipe with multiple hits. They experienced visual distortions, including small sparkles appearing in the room after the first hit. The second hit caused reality to start fading away, and on the third hit, they felt vibrations and saw geometric lines forming symbols. These lines eventually coalesced into the shape of a woman's head, which smiled at them before welcoming them ""in."" 

The participant then entered an expansive space filled with light and colors, feeling small but not scared. They flew through this space until they reached what was described as ""the Waiting Room,"" which unfolded into multiple dimensions. After leaving the room, they encountered two counter-rotating cones that extended upwards and downwards infinitely.

Upon returning to reality, the participant could see their surroundings in both normal and altered states for several minutes. Their friend appeared with a crystalline headdress, and their wife's eyes exploded with stars when viewed through this altered perception. The participants' disorientation lasted only a few moments before they returned to normal consciousness without any lingering effects."
49,80701,"The participant and a friend were sitting around a campfire in a wooded area late at night when they decided to consume a substance (DMT). After inhaling a large dose of the substance, the participant experienced visual distortions such as rhythmic warping of space. They then saw an infinite expanse of grid-like structures that transformed into semi-three-dimensional figures.

A humanoid figure emerged from this grid work and welcomed the participant to its world before disappearing. The participant found themselves in what appeared to be a coffee shop-like setting with infinitely high corridors, brightly lit inhabitants, and tall beings draped in white silky cloaks. These beings had black eyes contrasting with their colorless surroundings and moved about without acknowledging the participant.

The experience then shifted to another dimension where time and space were chaotic, with multiple hands on a symbolic clock recording changes that overwhelmed the participant. The participant was instructed by an unknown voice to open their eyes, which revealed horizontal rainbow trails sweeping across the landscape. Upon returning to reality, the surroundings had taken on a greenish alien hue.

The experience left the participant feeling euphoric and reborn, as if they were seeing the world for the first time."
50,77678,"The participant initially tested a small amount of DMT, experiencing mild visual distortions and an increase in adrenaline. Later that night, they smoked the substance with a friend, noting intense visual and auditory effects but no entities. In subsequent solo sessions, the user reported encountering multiple entities, both positive and negative, along with vivid visuals and sounds. The first session was particularly overwhelming, with high-pitched tones and laughing voices competing for attention. Visuals were described as extremely complex and disorienting. A later session outside the house was more welcoming, featuring a grid overlay with an eye in the center of vision and female entities presenting beautiful shapes and colors."
51,78447,"The subject received three injections of a psychoactive substance over the course of about two hours. After the first injection, they experienced an increasing awareness of color and intricate visual designs such as spirals and Aztec-like patterns. The participant reported seeing a green dome that changed rapidly and beautiful fish skeletons. They also perceived a spinning globe and felt a pull backwards in time.

The subject then described a picture of Christ on the cross appearing on the wall, which they could walk into with ease. This was followed by feelings of empathy and detachment from their surroundings. The effects lasted about 30 minutes before beginning to wane.

After the second injection, the participant reported much stronger visual hallucinations and an even greater sense of euphoria. They described seeing stars turning in their courses and feeling as if they were ripped to their essential self. The experience was intense but without unpleasant physiological symptoms.

The third injection acted as a bridge, throwing the subject beyond former comprehension into a timeless level above reasoning context. Visual scenes similar to LSD experiences were reported, but with an added sense of being beyond them. The participant felt stripped bare and saw demoniac forces that were brushed aside by the experience.

Overall, the substance produced vivid visual hallucinations, feelings of euphoria, altered perceptions of time and space, and a strong sense of oneness with everything around them."
52,69969,"The participant began feeling relaxed after taking a substance and prepared for their experience. They inhaled twice from a pipe, experiencing increasing difficulty holding in the smoke during the second hit. Upon lying down, they heard a crackling sound and saw symmetrical patterns forming before everything turned 3D. In this new state, they perceived themselves inside a dome with eyes around it and an object resembling a metallic praying mantis leg with eyeballs at both ends. This object rotated in unpredictable angles, creating the sensation of being behind the scenes of their brain, experiencing complex geometrical languages that represented emotions and desires.

As the experience began to fade, the participant felt intense euphoria and physical sensations similar to writhing in ecstasy. Upon returning to reality, they noticed vivid, flowing geometric patterns on everything around them with extremely vibrant colors. They quickly wrote down notes about their experience and were eager to share it with someone else."
53,63917,"The individual began their experience by inhaling a substance through a pipe while sitting on the floor with another person. After the first inhalation, reality became two-dimensional and colorful, with objects appearing to pulse. The second inhalation caused them to melt onto the floor as they entered what seemed like a small doctor's office waiting room.

In this environment, there were pastel colors scrolling vertically and school-like chairs arranged around the room. An entity resembling a poorly molded clay biped sat in one of the chairs and directed the participant towards a plasma door. Passing through this door led to an encounter with a giant woman in a flowing white gown who assured them everything would be okay.

The participant then fell into a black vortex, eventually emerging into space where they observed numerous galaxies before returning to Earth. Upon re-entering their physical body, they experienced a gold plasma emanating from the floor, containing bacteria-like creatures and pulsing patterns. This phenomenon was described as being present but invisible without the substance's influence."
54,49585,"The individual experienced an intense journey characterized by vivid visuals and encounters with multiple entities. Initially, there was a sudden onset of visual disturbances, including dark fields of vision that gradually filled with vibrant patterns and colors. Tunnel-like visions were reported, along with intertwining vines and mirror images extending into infinity. The participant noted the presence of numbers and patterns without limits.

Voices and whispers surrounded them, discussing various aspects of life. As the experience progressed, the individual encountered a field with strange entities and colors, including purple hues and glowing sensations. They ascended to great heights, experiencing a splicing sensation where their body felt segmented into different parts. Laughter was heard, and there were references to uncontrollable forces.

The participant then entered what they described as a lizard kingdom, encountering an infinitely large temple with pulsating beats and Mayan symbols. Various colored lizards were present, and the individual engaged in conversations with entities that had familiar yet alien qualities. The experience included erotic encounters and cosmic visions of galactic proportions.

Throughout the journey, there were mentions of DMT-like patterns and entities, including a friendly being referred to as ""ska."" The participant reported blacking out after approximately 10 minutes according to their sitter."
55,50526,"The experience began in a calm apartment setting with three participants. The first dose resulted in visual hallucinations of dark blue lines and dancing cartoon mushrooms. After about 30 seconds, the participant emerged from the trance and spoke excitedly to others present.

A second higher dose led to intense visual effects, including bright colors that felt physically painful. The participant entered a room made of woven light threads where three entities appeared. These entities were described as friendly, genderless beings wearing black khaki pants and white button-up shirts. One entity had an orange, transparent head resembling weaved light threads.

Subsequent scenes included encounters with additional entities in different settings. A sister-like figure was seen running across a blue face, while a mother and father entity appeared in a house within a garden. These parent figures emerged from the ground like fold-out structures and sat at a table facing the participant. They were described as imposing and intimidating.

The fourth dose resulted in negative feelings of guilt and contemplation about life. The visual experience included a bright realm where the participant was represented as a block figure moving through space. After this final dose, the participant felt emotionally and physically drained with melting and crawling visuals upon opening their eyes."
56,43682,"On a cloudy Saturday evening, two individuals prepared for an experiment involving a substance known for its intense effects. They had previous experience with various psychedelics but were new to this particular substance. The next day, they traveled to a scenic location by a lake and then returned home to begin the trial.

The first participant smoked a dose of approximately 30mg and experienced visual distortions and shaking hands. He did not fully break through into what he perceived as another dimension. The second participant, after smoking a similar dose, felt intense effects immediately and saw transparent fractals and colors flowing in patterns from light sources. After about five minutes, the visuals began to fade.

Later that day, both participants tried again. The first individual improved his technique but still did not fully break through. The second participant smoked 40mg this time and experienced a more profound journey. He found himself in an altered state of consciousness where he perceived complex geometric patterns and felt as if dimensions were merging and disappearing.

During this experience, the second participant encountered a squid-like entity with anatomical features such as eyes, mouth, and tentacles. The entity communicated through clicking and humming sounds and seemed friendly. It climbed onto his body and inserted its tongue from ear to ear, causing an unusual but pleasurable sensation of energy and happiness. After opening his eyes, the entity was gone.

The second participant felt a strong sense of satisfaction and excitement upon returning to baseline. He expressed a desire to explore this altered state again in the future, finding it fascinating and beyond description with current language."
57,39857,"On New Year's Eve, the participant joined a group of friends in a bedroom setting for an unknown substance experience. They were instructed by their guide to inhale deeply from a pipe filled with the substance and lie down with closed eyes. The initial physical sensations included a synthetic feeling in the body and lungs that felt like plastic or aluminum foil.

The participant then entered what they described as a giant swirling disc of colored patterns, similar to a ""chrysanthemum."" They experienced fluid pouring out of various parts of their body, losing the sensation of having a physical form. There was an impression of being in a hospital with doctors monitoring them, though this part is unclear due to a lapse in consciousness.

Upon regaining awareness, they felt energy rising from their spine accompanied by sounds like applause and cheering. Opening their eyes revealed the room bathed in semi-liquid diamonds and emeralds. The energy traveled through their body as sound and light, moving into their guide's head and back again, creating a shared experience described as an ""orgasm within the pineal gland.""

The participant felt profound peace upon returning to normal consciousness, free from depression and anxiety. They embraced their guide, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to discover something deeply personal yet indescribable.

During the rest of the party, they pondered the meaning of the experience quietly. The guide mentioned that the sound emitted by the participant seemed to convey a profound understanding of existence directly into his mind, bypassing conventional language. This left an impression on everyone present, even those under the influence of other substances.

In the days following, the participant felt tranquil and inspired, with a new perspective on life's ups and downs as potential teachers rather than obstacles."
58,10437,"The participant ingested a combination of substances that led to a gradual onset of effects starting around 7:00 PM. They experienced visual phenomena including a web-like structure made of silver threads with multi-colored tentacles, which they described as becoming animated. This was accompanied by a state characterized as 'mycelial consciousness' or 'plant consciousness'. Around 7:38 PM, the participant ingested DMT and entered what they referred to as 'hyperspace', experiencing rapid movement through tunnels in zero gravity. Upon penetrating another membrane/bubble, they encountered a hexagonal machine-like structure that reformed itself according to harmonic tones, redirecting their attention to various intersections/nodes. Each time their attention was directed to these nodes, visions and revelations occurred, including one related to human history and reincarnation. The experience concluded with the participant emitting vocal sounds that coincided with changes in visual content and physical environment."
59,20717,"The account describes three drug-induced experiences. The first experience began with visual fractals and led to meeting three blue entities: two male-like and one female, who communicated the importance of mindfulness through their actions and words. During this encounter, the participant was urged to quiet their mind but shared details of the experience with a friend, angering the entities.

The second experience involved entering a dark corridor where several glowing blue beings were practicing yoga. These beings aimed to teach the participant about achieving mindful states through natural means such as yoga. The participant chose to stay and learn from them for a few minutes before returning to reality, later signing up for yoga classes.

In the third experience, patterns and colors of India dominated the visual field, with glowing lights teaching holistic breathwork techniques. After practicing these techniques, the participant encountered light forms that were initially seductive but then revealed a message about physical desires leading to self-destruction."
60,20398,"The participants prepared two dosages of a substance for their first shared experience in a darkened room lit only by candlelight. They smoked the substance simultaneously, leading to an immediate onset of intense effects. The author reported seeing a female entity resembling a medieval witch with triangular head and human-like body, who smiled and extended her hand towards him but was not approached due to intimidation.

Following this, both participants witnessed a multi-armed goddess dancing against a golden background, which they perceived as having deep meaning and beauty. They then merged into one object, floating and spinning in a sea of color and light. Another entity dressed in disco-influenced conquistador clothing appeared, gesturing for the author to follow it into another room; however, this was not followed due to unease.

The author also experienced small machine-like forms exploring his body without touching him, as well as wolf-like creatures with lizard heads swimming past his eyes. These visions continued until about seven minutes after ingestion when the effects began to wane. The remaining fifteen minutes were characterized by pleasant awareness, warmth, relaxation, and euphoria before returning to normalcy."
61,9024,"The account describes guidelines for enhancing the experience of a substance. It recommends using low lighting to avoid bright light but not complete darkness. The environment should be quiet with minimal talking nearby as language can diminish the experience. Comfortable seating is advised, and a focal point such as a candle flame or plant against a plain wall can aid in visual experiences.

Music without lyrics is suggested to enhance the trip, and volume should be at a comfortable level. A guide or sitter holding the pipe and possibly whispering positive words during inhalation is recommended. The account emphasizes smiling before, during, and after inhalation as it significantly improves the experience. Chanting and deep breathing are also advised during the peak of the experience."
62,8979,"The individual began the experience in a living room setting at 11:24 am, using a hand water pipe with moderate lighting and music playing. After inhaling the substance, they experienced rapid visual changes characterized by liquidizing reality and fast-moving colors. The participant reported seeing mosaic patterned matrices and experiencing overwhelming floods of information with looping thoughts.

Opening their eyes after about three to four minutes revealed an overwhelming liquid color effect in the living room, prompting them to close their eyes again. They felt disoriented upon standing up and took several more minutes to regain focus. For the next 20 minutes, closing their eyes continued to produce geometric visuals and a sense of euphoria.

The experience lasted approximately five minutes before the visual effects began to recede. The individual reported no aftereffects or lingering psychosis two hours post-experience."
63,7143,"The individual began their experience lying on their childhood bed with headphones playing music. After inhaling the substance, they felt themselves leave their body and enter an altered dimension filled with thousands of welcoming entities. These entities appeared to be made of multi-colored energy balls and formed into various shapes, including a ball of blue stonish grey that seemed friendly towards them.

The participant experienced radical perspective shifts and intense emotions, feeling mentally aware throughout the experience despite the surreal visuals. They communicated their joy by yelling ""Oh my god, so good, so beautiful!"" The entities they encountered had detailed physical descriptions, such as one with a mostly black face but colorful features. These beings interacted with the individual in a friendly manner, sometimes poking and tugging at them without causing discomfort.

The experience lasted approximately 10 minutes but felt much longer to the participant. Afterward, they ran outside and performed a flip for the first time in their life, feeling elated upon landing on the grass."
64,131,"The individual began their experience in a home setting, near wall art depicting blues, purples, and pastel yellows. They inhaled an essence and experienced tingling sensations followed by vivid visual distortions of colors and geometric shapes that seemed to teach them a breathing technique. The participant felt a sense of responsibility for their family and path.

Entities appeared as colorful, animated playground objects and a child figure, which the individual interpreted as innocence. A silver-colored female entity named Silvergirl also appeared, expressing affection and guidance. When the experience began to fade, the participant inhaled again but encountered dark, smoky visuals and two large guardian-like entities that advised against hasty re-entry into the altered state.

Silvergirl reappeared with ghostlike features, confirming that oral consumption of the substance would allow for a longer stay in the altered state. The guardians nodded their approval before the experience transitioned to a dream-like sequence involving male figures working out and flexing muscles. Silvergirl's laughter caused this scene to vanish, returning the participant to reality."
65,1961,"In this dream experience, the narrator begins by imagining a low dosage of a substance that initially causes a lack of awareness and unclarity. As the effects peak, they transition into a more blissful state but still feel disconnected from reality. The narrator then uses another substance, which brings in smiling entities that perform a ""house cleaning"" and leave a message of self-affirmation before departing.

A week later, the narrator dreams of using a higher dosage of the first substance after consuming cannabis to manage potential side effects. This time, they achieve a clear state of consciousness described as being suspended between polarities, experiencing pure awareness and access to their ""data bank."" They navigate through neural networks, discovering limiting beliefs that had previously caused sickness.

The experience is followed by a descent back to baseline without discomfort, thanks to the cannabis consumed beforehand. The next day, the narrator feels rejuvenated and physically healthy."
66,1843,"The participant inhaled vapor from a pipe containing a crystalline substance, experiencing an immediate onset of effects. Initially, they felt a buzzing sensation accompanied by oscillating light waves in their peripheral vision. As more vapor was inhaled, the intensity increased, causing shimmering and sparkling visual distortions throughout the room.

Entities appeared on the ceiling as small people: a troll, a clown, a harlequin, and an imp. These beings engaged in playful behavior, including laughing and bouncing a complex geometric shape between them. The participant then entered a realm filled with sexual imagery, where objects transformed into erotic symbols and their lover's presence was felt vividly.

The experience shifted again as the participant perceived surfaces as windows into swirling dimensions, revealing holographic images that changed based on viewing angle. They observed matter in a constant state of flux, reinventing itself continuously. This led to a realization of interconnectedness between all things, which resonated with their personal cosmology.

Physical sensations included tightened facial muscles and an electric fluid covering the body. The participant felt energized and spiritually activated after the experience, leading to creative output and enhanced intimacy with their partner."
67,1768,"The participant consumed a green liquid mixture containing ground plant material and seeds. Within 15 minutes of ingestion, they experienced vomiting but continued to feel effects for about three hours. The visual hallucinations were described as highly detailed and realistic, featuring stylized images reminiscent of ancient religious art. They felt their mind had left the body and entered a realm where consciousnesses reside, experiencing intense emotions including terror and euphoria. During this time, they questioned their sanity and the nature of reality. By the fourth hour, they returned to normal awareness but remained shell-shocked.

In the second part, the participant consumed another green liquid mixture and smoked an extract from a different plant while under the influence of the initial substance. They experienced severe convulsions and felt as though they had summoned a demon from another dimension. The demon attempted to take control of their body, causing them to scream uncontrollably. After collapsing, they believed the demon was inside them and feared for their life. This lasted about an hour before subsiding into sedation and terror. They later discussed the experience with others who also had intense reactions."
68,115105,"The individual had three sessions with a substance. The first two were at lower doses (5-10mg and 25mg), resulting in euphoria, visual clarity, and bodily tingling sensations. In the third session, at a higher dose of 60mg, they experienced intense effects including rapid heartbeat, euphoria, and a sense of their consciousness expanding. They perceived geometric patterns and felt their soul separate from their body, entering what appeared to be a gray cube world filled with intricate designs. A naked woman was encountered in this realm, followed by two shaman-like figures who communicated with each other and seemed welcoming. The participant also experienced hunger during the trip. After returning to normal consciousness, they reported lingering feelings of depersonalization for several days."
69,106049,"The narrator and four friends attempted to vaporize a substance, resulting in varying levels of effects among participants. The narrator experienced mild visual and auditory changes, including color-tinting abilities and fluctuating voice pitch. After the initial attempt, two friends decided to try again using a different method involving ingesting seeds and a dissolved substance.

During this second experience, the narrator felt intense euphoria and appreciation for nature's beauty while under a tree in a green valley. The narrator then took an additional dose of the substance back at their room, leading to a breakthrough experience after smoking marijuana with friends.

The breakthrough involved vivid visual hallucinations of complex geometric patterns and structures, accompanied by alien-like music. Upon opening eyes, colors fluctuated around faces, and physical sensations included nausea and the need to defecate. The narrator enjoyed a burger meal before resting in their room, feeling physically drained but emotionally uplifted the next day."
70,116663,"The participant began their trip by vaporizing a combination of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT. Initially, they experienced familiar DMT-induced geometric visuals but these quickly transformed into more mushroom-like effects. A presence emerged, communicating with the participant in both visual and physical forms. The entity guided the participant through various experiences, including acknowledging their partner's individuality and feeling deep love and compassion.

The participant then entered a dance trance, moving freely to music while experiencing elevated energy levels and occasional purging. As the effects subsided, they felt sober but elated. Throughout the trip, the participant experienced physical sensations such as an elevated heart rate and chest pressure, indicative of sympathetic activation."
71,116515,"The participant began their journey by vaporizing a substance, leading to rapid onset visual and auditory hallucinations. They experienced a black/bluish background initially, which they later interpreted as possibly underwater or in a womb-like space. The visuals included deep sea colors with flashes of bright golden tubes resembling DNA strands.

As the experience progressed, the participant found themselves in an environment filled with golden, orange, and yellow landscapes that transformed into faces and other intricate images. Machine elves or jesters appeared, showing rapid-changing visual scenes and communicating without words but conveying a sense of joy and eagerness to share their wonders.

The participant then witnessed a golden city from above, observing a bee-like entity with flowing colors. They felt the urge to ask questions about creativity but were initially hesitant due to the overwhelming experience. A female energy communicated telepathically, providing an answer that the participant later interpreted as related to creativity and artistic expression.

Exiting this realm, they experienced a warm hug before returning to baseline consciousness. The open-eyed visuals persisted for a short while after removing the blindfold. The participant then attempted another dose of the substance, leading to darker and emptier visuals compared to the first experience.

In the second journey, the participant encountered aggressive jesters and an entity inside what appeared to be a jack-in-the-box, feeling trapped momentarily before being released. They saw a golden city from within, observing entities engaged in singular orgies or masturbation-like activities. The panic of being trapped subsided as they realized it was part of the experience.

Exiting this realm, the participant briefly witnessed a busy terminal with two entities: a purple alien woman and a tall businessman. Upon returning to baseline, they expressed gratitude for the experience but felt eager to return for more, noting that the entire journey lasted under an hour."
72,116303,"The participant began their session in a comfortable setting, seated in a dark room with ambient music playing softly. They vaporized a dose of 22mg through e-mesh and immediately felt an intense onset, described as being ""strapped to the front of a rocket."" The visuals included geometric patterns that seemed to evolve and mutate rapidly.

The participant encountered a tunnel-like structure with columns similar to those depicted in Alex Grey's artwork. Beyond this, they experienced complex geometries that communicated telepathically. These entities were perceived as powerful and somewhat irritated, emphasizing messages like ""you wanted this experience"" and ""you chose this."" The participant felt their mouth was immobilized during these interactions.

The experience included intense physical sensations in the head, described as electrons colliding with brain matter. There was a sense of fear but also an overwhelming feeling that death is part of the human condition, leading to inner peace about mortality.

Later in the trip, a dragon-like entity appeared, emitting soothing sounds and helping the participant calm down. The experience gradually faded back into normal awareness after approximately 11 minutes.

The participant felt gratitude for being alive and resolved to bring more love and connection into their daily interactions with others."
73,115605,"The participant began by smoking a small amount of the substance, experiencing vivid colors and pleasant body sensations. Later, they smoked a larger dose intending to have an intense ""breakthrough"" experience. Upon inhaling, they immediately felt overwhelmed by bright yellow and green visuals that transformed their surroundings into a matrix of colorful Tetris blocks and soft sand.

The participant's body seemed to merge with the couch, becoming part of the colorful environment. They could grab pieces of their own body in the form of rainbow sand but felt no physical sensation. This led to panic as they feared death or brain damage. Their brother appeared as a black Tetris block initially but later interacted normally, asking if the participant was okay.

The participant's phone transformed into a spiral and then teleported back into their hand, at which point they briefly became the phone themselves. They experienced anxiety attacks and hyperventilation while trying to leave the room. The bathroom provided some relief as there were fewer colors and more darkness.

After showering for about one minute, the participant returned to normalcy with no lasting damage but felt shaken by the experience. The entire trip lasted approximately 5-7 minutes according to their brother, though it seemed much longer to the participant."
74,90894,"The experience began around 7:35 PM on a Sunday evening. The participant ingested an unknown substance and felt its effects after two inhalations. As the third hit was consumed, there was a rapid shift in perception without any falling sensation. Visuals appeared as if the world had been submerged in a watery substance with slow swaying movements. Objects began to fade away, making it difficult for the participant to focus.

With eyes closed, intense and unstoppable visuals filled their vision, including checkerboard patterns of various colors that zoomed in different directions. From these patterns emerged other shapes and forms that were hard to describe clearly. The participant also saw visions of speeding through colorful wormholes and approaching vast planes of squares. These visual experiences were continuous without any finality.

As the music intensified, humanoid figures appeared, resembling those found in ancient Chinese art with exaggerated features. They danced in a pattern similar to a tapestry, swaying their hips to the beat of tribal-themed music. The participant held tightly onto their roommate's hand due to anxiety and fear of leaving behind their ego.

The visual effects began to fade after about 20 minutes, though there were still tracers around physical objects. The participant was coherent enough to describe what they had seen. They stood outside on the balcony for twenty more minutes, observing the world with a clearer psychological perspective but no marked changes visually."
75,115425,"The participant began by describing a shift in perception towards an egoless state of beingness over the past few weeks. They prepared for their experience through meditation and mindfulness practices. On the day of the trip, they vaporized approximately 50mg of a substance and inhaled it deeply. Within seconds, their vision exploded into fractals of colors, and they heard intense humming sounds. The participant felt their body dissolve as all awareness of physicality faded.

They encountered an entity described as a ""Tryptamine Jester,"" which was short, thin, and humanoid with a mosaic of colors oscillating on its technological light energy body. This being communicated telepathically about the nature of existence, including the concept that everything is god and that this life is just one option for growth and learning.

The participant's consciousness then traveled beyond all realms of existence to an unmanifest void where their individuated self was obliterated and merged with the totality of existence. They experienced a state of being as the ground of all creation before deciding to create new realms and incarnate again as an individuated consciousness.

Upon returning, they communicated with two Jesters in a geometric fractal room about their human life and the nature of existence. The Jesters confirmed that the participant was already on the path of truth and nondual realization. After this interaction, the participant's consciousness rapidly returned to their body, reconstructing their physical form and psychological state.

The experience concluded with insights about godhood, the perfection of existence, and the game of pretending to forget one's true nature. The participant felt that while the trip was profound, it confirmed much of what they already knew due to recent shifts in consciousness."
76,109508,"The participant and two friends took an unknown substance and went to the roof of a five-story building for the experience. Upon inhalation, visual distortions began almost immediately. The skyline appeared with lights having prismatic halos, and the moon was seen as four collinear moons in different colors, each with its own rainbow halo. Pseudo-Northern lights were observed over the cityscape, sometimes forming figures like a large face and a sleeping goddess.

The participant then took another dose for closed-eye visuals, which included intricate patterns, faces, carnival rides, dandelions, and vivid backdrops. They also experienced auditory hallucinations described as buzzing in the ears. Mentally, the experience was reflective but not particularly humorous.

Later, they repeated the process indoors with smaller doses. The participant's friend D had orange skin and purple hair under the influence of the substance. Closed-eye visuals were intense and disorganized at first but then formed a uniform spiral pattern before fading into a void.

In another room, three humanoid beings appeared seated at a table, their bodies adorned with geometric patterns. They communicated in an unintelligible language and engaged in ritualistic behavior involving food consumption and kissing. The experience was interrupted by a knock on the door from a building official.

Afterwards, the participant reflected on the meaning of the visions, interpreting them as a lesson about moderation in seeking pleasure and its impact on innovation and societal advancement."
77,115363,"The individual prepared for their experience by meditating and creating a safe environment in their bedroom. They smoked a substance from a bong and felt immediate physical effects, including difficulty moving and an urge to hug a stuffed animal. As they exhaled, they reported losing consciousness for about 8 minutes, during which time they perceived themselves as part of a crystalline pattern encompassing all of existence.

Upon returning to reality, the individual experienced intense visual distortions such as fractal afterimages and trails from objects. They also noted significant auditory distortion, with sounds appearing slowed down. The environment played a role in their experience; for example, a tape over light switches read ""don't!!!,"" which they interpreted as advice not to panic.

The individual engaged in a dialogue between their ego and an observer within themselves, expressing understanding and gratitude. They interacted with visual representations of loved ones on their phone screen, consciously altering the images to positive forms. After calming down, they cuddled a stuffed animal before sitting upright and observing the patterns around them stabilize.

Overall, the experience brought about feelings of calm, appreciation for life, and an enhanced sense of creativity."
78,101076,"The participant prepared for the experience by dividing the substance into dosages and using a chillum to inhale it. They took two large hits and felt their heart pounding and vision becoming more spaced out. Lying down, they perceived an entity looking at them expectantly. After exhaling after 2 minutes and 15 seconds, they experienced intense visual patterns of blue, purple, and hot pink eyes in a checkerboard pattern.

The participant heard a voice asking if they were alright, which sounded like their mother. They felt anxious and overwhelmed by the judgmental entities surrounding them with thousand eyes. The experience included vivid visions such as a Buddhist palace made of gold, purple, and blue, and Buddha's smiling face wearing hoop earrings. A petrified Indian statue resembling an aunt also appeared.

The participant tried to remember aspects of their normal life but found it difficult due to the intensity of the experience. They felt comforted by listening to their favorite song and acknowledging themselves in that moment. Warm sensations built up inside them, reducing anxiety as they spiraled into a cosmic web of yellow and blue patterns.

They encountered purple and blue Indian entities and had a gut feeling about their mind expanding into a green fractal flower. The experience included flying through kaleidoscope patterns and mesmerizing entities with feelings of serenity. They emerged from a hot pink river to find four blue and pink vacationers taking photos, then returned to trans-dimensional hyperspace.

The participant observed nets of checkerboards in 2D form but with depth, along with yellow fire on the left and red bubbling from blackness on the right. An Indian entity telepathically spoke to them, saying ""You're the quiet one."" The experience ended after about nine minutes when a friend's snickering broke the patterns.

Upon opening their eyes, they saw a distorted, wavy reality and forgave their friends for laughing at them. They laughed easily with their friends afterward despite the seriousness of the experience. Two months later, hearing someone say ""You're the quiet one"" triggered an anxiety attack similar to the DMT experience, especially when smoking cannabis."
79,115023,"The participant consumed multiple substances, including THH and DMT, over several hours in an old farmhouse with two other people. Initially, they experienced mild effects such as CNS arousal and dilated pupils but did not have a significant trip until later. After consuming a biscuit, the participant observed intricate fractal patterns on a cloth covering a light, which transformed into a glowing orb containing a jaguar head. The jaguar was perceived as a spirit guide leading to the spirit world.

The participant felt hungry and disoriented throughout the experience. They engaged in activities such as playing music and discussing life plans with one of the other participants, Micah. During this time, they experienced mild paranoid delusions about government surveillance after noticing that music playback seemed to be controlled by an external force. The trip peaked for approximately an hour before plateauing and lasting around four hours total."
80,102069,"The participant smoked a substance with friends and then prepared another dose for themselves and their friend. After the friend consumed the substance, the participant took their turn, experiencing visual distortions that made colors and forms appear surreal. They felt waves of positive energy and noticed their hands twisting and distorting in unusual ways.

An entity appeared as a feminine presence, communicating through words and gestures. The entity expressed enthusiasm for the participant's progress and shared concepts such as 'magic' and 'remember.' The participant experienced brief flashes of memories or scenarios, including a car accident on the way to the friend's apartment.

The entity encouraged the participant to maintain a happy demeanor and continue exploring visual arts. It also conveyed that the realm they were in was eternal and that the participant had saved the world through their actions. As the effects began to wane, the entity urged the participant to focus and maintain the connection or moment forever.

After the experience, the participant shared recaps with their friend while watching an animated television series and smoking cannabis together."
81,107029,"The individual begins their experience with auditory sensations that intensify after multiple inhalations. They are transported to an alien dimension characterized by geometric perfection, warmth, and happiness. This realm is not bound by three-dimensional laws and consists of colorful, intricate structures.

During this exploration, the participant occasionally senses a noncorporeal being of immense intellect but finds it uninterested in them. As night falls within this dimension, the environment darkens to an advanced level of blackness, filled with hopelessness and terror. A group of skyscraper-sized humanoid figures with spiraling, razor-sharp teeth emerge from the darkness below, attacking relentlessly.

The next day brings a return to the beautiful realm, but now the beings are interested in the participant, offering empathy and kindness. Nightfall triggers another attack by the monstrosities, accompanied by psychological torment. The individual copes by focusing on positive thoughts and gratitude.

On subsequent days, the participant grapples with existential questions about their situation, fearing eternal imprisonment within this realm. Each night brings renewed terror from the dark entities. By the fourth day, the participant experiences ego death, losing all sense of self and emotions, which serves as a coping mechanism for the remaining nights.

After seven days, the individual's sense of self gradually returns, along with periodic flashes of reality that become more frequent until they are fully back in their familiar environment."
82,101977,"The participant inhaled a substance and immediately experienced visual hallucinations characterized by two-dimensional shapes resembling pale-yellow coffin-shaped cardboard cutouts with amorphous patterns at each tip. These visuals were accompanied by an ascending crescendo of sound, described as partly humming and partly yelling. The participant then saw flower-like replicating and blossoming blocks of white, yellow, purple, and brick-red patterns, as well as a vibrantly rotating and expanding quadrilateral that was gilded-brown in color.

The experience included feelings of anxiety about the unnaturalness of the situation, followed by awe at the visuals. The participant felt a desire to share their experience but also questioned their motivations for doing so. There was an internal struggle between analytical thinking and acceptance, with the latter leading to a more immersive and wondrous experience, though it came with forgetfulness.

The participant experienced dread from an acknowledgment of loneliness and predetermined life course, which alternated with feelings of connectedness and shared human experience. They also felt a sense of mortality and meaning in life. The vivid colors eventually gave way to encroaching blackness, leading to a state described as beyond nothingness, symbolized by a flame-colored barrier.

Gradually, the participant regained awareness of their earthly surroundings, with sounds from the living room reaching them. Upon opening their eyes, they found themselves slightly tearful and saw their popcorn ceiling revolving in layers of variegated purples and reds."
83,114245,"The individual prepared for their experience by practicing mindful breathing, tidying up, and sitting comfortably in a soft chair. They held an aquamarine crystal and asked for guidance from the substance before taking the first long draw from a vaporizer cartridge. After inhaling deeply, they felt intense physical sensations including body vibrations, auditory hallucinations, and a sense of being held down or ""strapped in."" The experience included involuntary contortions of facial muscles guided by closed-eye visuals, which the individual likened to an alien-induced chiropractic session.

After coming down from the first dose, the person decided to take a second dose while lying naked on the floor with sunlight over their face. They held crystals and an optical calcite during this phase. The experience included rapid strobing visual effects in closed eyes, further involuntary contortions of facial muscles, and intense breathing exercises involving various orifices. The individual performed yoga-like movements and vocalized sounds as part of these clinical hallucinations.

The trip concluded with the person returning to a seated position, putting on clothes, and smoking cannabis to return to their day-to-day state."
84,96562,"The participant began by inhaling a large amount of substance through vaporization after consuming an MAOI sublingually 30 minutes prior. Upon inhalation, they experienced immediate sensory overload and a loss of time perception. Their environment, primarily consisting of pink abstract wallpaper, shattered into billions of puzzle pieces that rearranged themselves at high speed in a mechanical dance-like manner.

Entities were perceived as controlling each piece of the puzzle, communicating with one another and dancing to music provided by the participant. These entities caused the participant to feel increasingly overwhelmed, leading to concerns about their sanity and ability to return to normal reality. The new reality was described as having multiple dimensions beyond the usual three, making it difficult for the participant to comprehend.

As the experience progressed, the participant struggled with existential questions regarding eternity and control over their existence within this altered reality. They felt a stripping away of their humanity and an identity shift towards being just a soul navigating through the universe's endless dance.

Eventually, the entities began to slow down their mechanical rearrangement, gradually piecing together old reality. The room started forming again, and the participant regained awareness of having a body, although initially panicked as limbs were fused into surroundings. Over about five minutes, more puzzle pieces aligned back into familiar forms, bringing an end to the experience.

The participant expressed difficulty in fully remembering or conveying the intensity of their experience, likening it to a vivid dream that fades from memory quickly."
85,114111,"Two friends decided to explore an unknown substance together. They started with small doses and gradually increased the dosage until they reached a point where both felt significant effects. The first friend experienced discomfort and vomiting after his initial high dose. 

The narrator then took a higher dose, around 50mg, and entered a state of pure blackness before encountering colorful, glowing orbs. One orb merged with him, removing fear, while another removed sadness. This process continued until all emotions were taken away, leaving the narrator as an emotionless, blackish orb that expanded to encompass everything.

The experience concluded with the narrator returning to his human body. The friends experimented further with different dosages and music choices before one of them had a deeply unsettling encounter involving visions of future children, leading him to decide against using the substance again."
86,112599,"The participant attended a social gathering with friends where they decided to try an unknown substance using a vaporizer. Due to the lack of a scale, the exact dosage is unclear but estimated to be over 50mg. The first two participants experienced mild effects and enjoyed closed-eye visuals and bodily sensations.

Upon taking a larger dose, the participant felt intense physical and visual effects almost immediately. They saw intricate patterns on their friend's face and a small, jester-like figure hopping around the room. As they closed their eyes, they experienced an intense tracer effect and lost touch with reality. A voice in their head informed them that they had died and were now in a state of eternal non-existence.

The participant then entered a terrifying mindfuck where concepts like life, death, and existence were challenged. They felt no physical sensations and forgot who they were and everything else. The visuals were intense and rapidly shifting, including a red maze with black or white polka dots.

Towards the end of the trip, the scene shifted to an outer space-like environment with a beautiful sunset at the edge of the cosmos. There were alien-like structures around a deep orange star. As the effects began to wear off, the participant felt their body returning and opened their eyes, screaming in joy at being alive again.

After 30 minutes, they returned mostly to baseline but felt profoundly changed, with an increased appreciation for life and a more accepting outlook on things."
87,89763,"The individual reports multiple experiences with a psychoactive substance, starting with mild effects similar to other psychedelics and progressing to more intense states. During one session, they perceived their friend transforming into a reptilian-like being. In a subsequent solo session, after consuming a significant dose of the substance, the participant felt transported to what appeared to be a spaceship compartment. They observed an electronic sliding door, white walls, and a window showing stars outside. Multiple entities communicated in an alien language above them, observing the individual.

The experience continued with the sensation of traveling through space for an extended period, approximately 15-20 minutes. The participant then perceived their body transforming into that of a monkey, with thicker hair on their arms. After about 30 minutes, they returned to their bathroom but remained in a highly altered state. Visual distortions persisted, including the head floating away from the body and swirling patterns on the stomach.

The trip lasted at least an hour and a half, followed by lingering effects throughout the day, characterized by heightened sensory perception and unusual auditory hallucinations."
88,111538,"The individual experienced intense sensory changes after consuming a substance, leading to auditory hallucinations characterized by rising and falling tones. Closing their eyes resulted in vivid visualizations of being on a spaceship with advanced technology unlike anything seen before. They encountered two entities wearing space suits working on machinery reminiscent of satellite construction. The participant was presented with various toys designed for children, including those themed around Earth's orbit and the solar system. An entity pointed out the window to show an expansive universe filled with spaceships and creatures, describing it as bustling like New York City but with a yellow sky.

The individual was given white binders containing technical documents before being placed in an escape pod and returned to Earth. They interacted with a computer interface featuring purple buttons arranged in unusual shapes while observing a departing spaceship through windows above. The entities seemed interested in encouraging human technological advancement, providing guidance without direct answers but rather by suggesting experiments or play.

The next day, the participant experienced a hangover characterized by cerebral discomfort that lasted for one day. Since then, they have been reading more about physics and mathematics, feeling as though their intelligence has increased due to the experience."
89,112367,"The participant began their experience by inhaling from a bong and immediately felt tingling sensations spreading through their body. They entered a tunnel-like state with colored squares forming a grid around them, surrounded by a blue haze filled with stars. The participant then floated in an empty space, where they perceived music as part of the innerverse.

A male presence appeared beside the participant, communicating telepathically and guiding them forward. The participant felt mistrust and looked back, noticing two small flickering lights that grew brighter over time. The entity became annoyed by the participant's glances and applied pressure to their head, emphasizing the importance of the lights. Realizing the lights represented their daughters, the participant returned to awareness in the kitchen but experienced visual distortions.

The participant saw a series of nested cubes with numbers moving within them, restricting their field of vision. They felt enlightened yet frustrated by the inability to convey this understanding to others and worried about losing touch with reality or their family. Upon realizing it was a trip, the participant felt immense relief and sat down, smiling and sighing in gratitude."
90,112396,"The participant began feeling nervous before lying down for the experience. They inhaled three large pulls of vaporized substance and quickly entered a state of intense transformation. Initially, they saw a growing mandala-like shape that became chaotic and overwhelming. The air felt foreign and breathing was difficult but necessary to continue. After this phase, they found themselves in a dark green space with a shifting hue. They sensed an external presence urging them to tell their friends to leave.

Upon re-entering the visual realm, they saw the wall of their bedroom with a deep green hue. An entity appeared behind them, described as a graceful cat-like creature with shiny gold fur and black stripes on its face. The entity had long legs, arms, and a curved tail that bounced slightly. It smiled at the participant in an admiring way.

The entity then performed a ritualistic gesture, forming a glass-like sphere between its hands and compressing it to transform the room into a chaotic whirling orb. The entity directed the participant to merge with the sphere, which they initially resisted but eventually allowed after regaining some control. This led to a disintegration of their awareness as if falling through layers of reality.

The experience concluded with the participant opening their eyes and feeling a brief moment of amnesia before processing what had happened."
91,112319,"The participant ingested a carefully prepared substance containing Syrian rue extract and 320 mg of brownish material. Initially, they experienced geometric patterns overlaying their visual perception. This was followed by waves of intense fear, existential dread, and physical discomfort including vomiting. The participant encountered an entity described as a hyperintelligent being resembling a multi-armed elephant from Indian mythology. They felt overwhelmed by the force of this experience, struggling with the fear of losing themselves forever. After several hours, the effects gradually diminished, leaving the participant in need of assistance."
92,104390,"The participant began their experience by smoking an unknown substance, likely in two doses. The first dose of around 30 mg produced mild effects that lasted about eight minutes. For the second attempt, they smoked approximately 55-60 mg and experienced a significant breakthrough.

Upon inhaling the second dose, the participant felt intense physical sensations throughout their body and noticed changes in their vision, which became tinted with shifting colors. They reported feeling compelled to lie down and ensure their door was locked before the experience intensified.

The visual hallucinations began with complex symbols that resembled letters combined with facial expressions, containing a flowing plasma-like substance with deep neon hues. These patterns were projected onto the participant's entire field of vision, warping their surroundings. The sounds around them also changed in an unprocessable way.

As the experience progressed, the participant saw groups of people whose faces were not visible but felt they could imagine individual personalities for each person. This led to a realization about the equality and interconnectedness of all individuals. 

The visual field then shifted upward, revealing two females with continuously shifting skin tones and finally the legs of a man whom the participant perceived as representing God. The participant tried to see his face but realized it was represented in earlier symbols.

This part of the experience culminated in intense crying and emotional realization about the nature of existence and interconnectedness. Afterward, the visual hallucinations transitioned into an oceanic blue vision that eventually faded, leaving the participant with a sense of euphoria and tranquility.

The overall effect lasted for several minutes after which the participant felt uplifted and relaxed, reflecting on their experience and its impact on their outlook on life."
93,86229,"The participant prepared for the experience by setting up a comfortable environment with calming music and aromatherapy. They smoked the substance using a glass bowl and experienced immediate physical effects including a harsh sensation in the lungs, increased heart rate, and body tremors. Visual distortions included warped perceptions of space and time, tilting room, and vibrating patterns.

Closing their eyes intensified the experience, revealing complex colorful patterns resembling a chessboard that tilted to reveal blackness. They also perceived faint lights similar to stars. Upon reopening their eyes, they felt disconnected from reality, finding our world shallow in comparison to the vivid otherworldly sensations.

The participant took another hit, intensifying previous effects and experiencing more vibrant visual patterns with a sense of happiness and detachment from ego. Physical symptoms included trembling during the experience and dilated pupils upon coming down."
94,100002,"The participant began by inhaling a substance, experiencing rapid heartbeat and tingly head sensations. Vision blurred rapidly, sound faded except for a humming sensation. A tunnel-like effect led to an array of intense colors and light. Balls of light appeared, pulling the user through an experience described as pure love and happiness. This was followed by darkness with shimmering patterns before physical sensations like heat waves occurred. The participant gradually returned to reality feeling content and questioning the nature of their surroundings."
95,101652,"The participant began smoking what they describe as a low dose of the substance, experiencing warmth and heaviness associated with its use. They noted a calm, light emptiness and connectedness to their surroundings, particularly under moonlight where initial visual effects were observed. As the intensity increased, the experience became similar to a tranquil strong acid trip, leading to deep cosmic reflections on interconnectedness.

The participant found that combining the substance with tobacco in a cigarette allowed for better control over the dose and intensity of the experience, making it more conducive to creative activities like writing or painting. However, at peak intensity, physical coordination was impaired, causing clumsiness when attempting to stand up."
96,111899,"The participant began their experience by taking a small dose of a powder mixed into a vaporizer. They felt an immediate onset of calmness and warmth as a buzzing sensation spread through their body, accompanied by visual distortions that transformed the chirping of birds into rippling patterns. The individual then took another pull from the vaporizer.

Visual hallucinations included blooming patterns, a serpent-like entity with a gaping maw, and a toroidal fountain where a slender fey figure emerged to dance. This fey creature dissolved into the center spiral, revealing layers of mental clutter that were pushed into the participant's being through bubbles formed by the flowing grid. The participant became part of the outer surface of the torus, able to move around in third-person perspective and observe their own being.

After about an hour, the participant opened their eyes at 0617, experiencing lingering geometric patterns. They felt euphoric and drifted off into a deep sleep before waking up feeling fantastic. The experience was described as a moment of internal clarity and preparation for deeper journeys, similar to but distinct from previous experiences with another substance."
97,94731,"The participant experienced three trips that began with lightheadedness after inhaling smoke from a bowl containing a substance mixed with peppermint leaf. During the first trip, they saw a mystical lady flying above them in a green and red tunnel before returning to reality. The second trip involved being inside a beautiful temple with golden geometric patterns on the walls; one wall had a ""Temple God"" resembling a lion's face that turned purple when focused upon. In the third trip, after increasing the dosage, they saw golden geometric patterns again and found themselves in a room with multiple exits. They realized that our everyday reality is just a subset of true reality, and time and space are constructs we have created. The participant felt their sense of self was destroyed but not negatively, and upon returning to normal consciousness, they were overwhelmed by the experience."
98,101222,"The participant injected a high dose of a psychedelic substance into their upper arm muscle. After about 7 minutes, they entered a state where everything appeared fake and synthetic, as if inside a dollhouse. Their girlfriend's face looked like she was wearing a mask, and objects around them seemed to be toys rather than functional items. The walls had slowly moving colored patterns on them.

The participant felt heavy and found walking difficult. Closing their eyes allowed them to perceive the presence of superior beings in another plane, though they could only see colored lines and patterns against bright white. These beings were indifferent to the participant's presence, similar to how a cat might regard a human looking at it.

After nearly an hour, the participant began coming down from the experience. They briefly felt insignificant but then observed themselves in the mirror with hands on either side, experiencing several jolts and feeling as if they had swapped places with their reflection. This sensation occurred multiple times before they became spooked and walked away. As they sat back down, they tried to reach the other plane again but could only see random patterns against a black background."
99,97548,"The participant experienced an out-of-body state after consuming a substance. They saw dark purple and blue fractals initially, which quickly gave way to vivid colors forming strips in their vision. In the center of these visuals was a complex, undefined shape resembling an hourglass or 3D infinity symbol that appeared to be flowing inward.

The participant felt surrounded by shadow-like figures, described as elongated shapes similar to long shadows on a sidewalk. These entities made frantic arm motions, attempting to pull the participant up and inviting them closer. The experience was not in a physical location but felt enclosed like a dome at the top.

Upon coming back to consciousness, the participant felt euphoric and delirious with joy."
100,92029,"The participant smoked an unknown quantity of a substance in their room while listening to music. They initially experienced mild psychedelic visuals such as colorful geometric patterns before entering a more intense phase where they perceived multiple humanoid beings around them, some described as maternal and sensual. A central entity appeared on the left side of their visual field, growing into a large sphere with many shapes inside it. This being communicated an all-encompassing message about power, sex, love, energy, money, and material goods.

The participant felt the presence of numerous beings surrounding them, described as having enormous power and positive energy. They experienced physical sensations such as wind blowing against them and alternating coldness and warmth throughout the trip. Time was distorted during this experience, making it difficult to describe linearly. As the main effects faded, they were left with deep personal insights and a sense of connection to their ancestors.

The participant also noted that the afterglow included synesthetic visual and auditory experiences synchronized with the music."
101,101882,"The participant inhaled a substance and experienced an immediate transformation of reality. Colors became brighter and deeper, and geometric patterns filled all empty space, forming intricate structures that were both detailed and vibrant. The participant lost their sense of self and entered a state of pure awareness without any mental interpretation or understanding. This state was characterized by an explosion of shape and color, described as timeless and infinite.

As the experience progressed, the participant fell into a state of nothingness before regaining tiny points of awareness. They slowly became aware of physical sensations such as burning lips and tasted something unpleasant in their mouth. The participant then experienced a return to reality with altered perceptions, where everything was vibrating and connected through patterns of energy. They observed layers of energy around themselves and others, including the dog.

The participant engaged in deep breathing exercises and felt clear, open, and peaceful. They perceived prana (life force) as obvious and began to interpret their experience, concluding that it represented a deeper level of existence that was always present but not naturally perceivable. The participant spontaneously cried, feeling grateful for their friendships.

Upon repeating the experience, the participant saw specific images and creatures communicating messages about relationships. They also observed visual representations of energy channels on the ceiling, which they associated with concepts like prana and the Nadi system."
102,91557,"The participant began their experience by smoking a substance from a pipe, feeling a whooshing sensation as they inhaled. They then lay down and saw large beings circling them before entering a colorful tunnel with two-dimensional beings dancing on the walls. Frightened but reminding themselves it would only last 10 minutes, they neared the end of the tunnel as their trip began to fade.

Upon reopening their eyes, they took another hit and re-entered a different tunnel, this time resembling an Alex Grey painting. They reached a dock with large gray spherical objects floating on fog. One sphere had a man dressed like an elevator attendant inside, who communicated that the participant could observe but not participate. The sphere faded as the participant opened their eyes involuntarily.

Back in their living room, they felt happy to be back and spent time with their dog before going outside to look at the sky. They reflected on the experience, believing the tunnel represented exiting the body and the dock was a place for souls to depart to their next destination."
103,97622,"A 21-year-old male experienced his first use of a psychedelic substance in a secluded location at night. He smoked a pipe containing damiana and DMT with an acquaintance who had prior experience with the drug. The taste was metallic and chemical, similar to JWH-018 but less intense.

After inhaling the smoke, he felt a strong body high within 3 seconds, followed by a rapid onset of dissociation where his body seemed to fade away while his brain remained active. He closed his eyes and entered an altered state characterized by vivid colors in various shapes that shifted rhythmically with music. The participant could not feel or smell anything but retained some auditory perception, which sounded metallic and alien.

Throughout the experience, he encountered a non-human entity that guided him through the journey. This figure was described as alive and not frightening. He opened his eyes periodically to ground himself, noticing that the dashboard of the car remained visible despite feeling body-less.

The intensity of the visuals and sensations gradually decreased over what felt like 10-15 minutes but was likely only a few minutes in reality. The participant expressed initial fear due to the rapid onset and loss of bodily awareness but eventually decided he enjoyed the experience, finding it beautiful and wanting to repeat it.

Aftereffects included mental stimulation and lucid dreaming that night. He concluded that DMT has significant potential as a tool for introspection and recommended grounding techniques such as opening eyes occasionally and facing familiar objects during the trip."
104,111424,"The individual began their experience by consuming a mixture of substances from a bong. Initially, they felt mild effects similar to those experienced during a mushroom trip. After taking another large inhalation, the intensity increased rapidly. The environment started fractaling, and the participant reported feeling slightly uncomfortable at first, with sensations described as somewhat demonic.

An angelic figure then appeared before them, floating in front of the individual. This entity encouraged the person not to be afraid and touched their head, causing a sudden shift in perception. The world shattered, revealing what the participant perceived as heaven, a parallel universe layered on Earth. They experienced an overwhelming sense of happiness and bliss.

Time seemed to move both quickly and slowly simultaneously. The visuals were described as colorful and dynamic, with smooth, flowing movements. The individual interacted with various heavenly beings and felt a sense of singularity. As the effects began to fade, there was a lingering sensation that this parallel universe remained but became invisible without the substance.

The entire experience lasted approximately 10-15 minutes. Post-experience, the participant initially felt sober but noticed some residual effects impacting their balance for up to an hour."
105,95805,"The participant injected a substance intravenously in a comfortable setting. They felt relaxed before the injection and experienced an immediate shift in perception upon administration. Initially, they felt disconnected from their surroundings but then realized they were part of the universe. This realization led to questioning the need to dispose of the syringe used for the injection.

The full effect hit quickly, transporting them into what seemed like an eternal void filled with love, empathy, and joy. They considered stopping their heart from beating to join this state permanently. Then, they found themselves in a 'control room' surrounded by entities who explained their presence and purpose. The participant observed these entities on a higher level before the trip characteristics shifted back to a more typical experience, though they continued to feel connected to everything.

After 15 minutes, the participant injected another dose, leading to a continuation of the previous experience."
106,98773,"In the first trip, the participant experienced a cat made of rainbow reflections laughing at them from an extended ceiling. This was followed by a second trip where the room turned black and red, walls and ceiling danced to a humming sound, and a ceiling fan with eyes mocked the user. The third trip resulted in minimal effects as the bowl contained only scrapings.

The fourth trip involved intense physical sensations such as drooling, melting body parts, and sinking floors covered in fog forming mandala-like patterns. In the fifth trip, the participant saw an orange light kaleidoscope on the ceiling and laughed uncontrollably before stepping outside to find nature's colors altered and a tree resembling lung tissue."
107,101221,"The participant injected 32mg of a substance into their vein, causing immediate physical sensations including warmth and tingling throughout the body. Visual hallucinations began within seconds, characterized by rapidly changing colors and shapes of objects in the room. The music seemed to speed up significantly, and the participant felt they had taken too much.

Closing their eyes, the participant experienced being transported to another dimension, described as dark with subtle dull colors, followed by a brightly colored environment with flashing streaks and euphoria. Upon returning to reality, the body felt heavy, and breathing was unnoticed despite occurring normally. The girlfriend's face appeared alien-like, with yellow rubber skin, two irises in one eye, and star-shaped pupils.

Visual distortions persisted for about a minute after the peak experience, with objects appearing in incorrect colors. Full sobriety returned within 15-20 minutes of the initial injection."
108,95295,"The experience began in a dimly lit room where the participant inhaled an unknown substance through a pipe. Initially, they felt body vibrations and saw geometric lines that shimmered and blended together. As the effects intensified, the participant became drowsy and less aware of their surroundings. They then entered a state of immersion with waves of repeating colors and a sense of detachment from their physical body.

A giant hand made of orthogonal shapes appeared, described as having a warm, motherly presence. The participant felt fear and tried to ground themselves by focusing on tactile sensations, such as rubbing their left index finger on their right hand. They struggled with the intensity of the experience but eventually regained control in spurts, seeing distorted glimpses of the room.

The participant returned to their body gradually, feeling happy and content. Upon returning fully, they saw the room painted in geometric shapes and felt a warm sensation throughout their body."
109,110578,"The participant began the experience feeling immense pressure inside their skull, as if their brain was being violently stretched and compacted. They also felt heavy pressure on their chest, a strange drilling noise that fluctuated in pitch, and vivid technicolor visuals projected into their mind. The sensation of ego dissolution occurred, where they no longer perceived themselves as an individual but rather as a stream of consciousness without physical form.

The participant saw every human face ever lived woven into mandala-style patterns that evolved into complex DNA strands, representing the collective energy of all living things. These patterns were accompanied by crackling electricity and a sense of performance art depicting humanity for judgment. The experience included both light and dark energies flowing in and out, leading to an understanding of duality and acceptance of all aspects as equal.

A featureless, white, humanoid figure was perceived as the source of all life, symbolizing the shared lifeforce among all living things. The participant felt embraced by everyone they had ever loved, experiencing a profound sense of safety and unity with the collective consciousness. This led to an understanding that individuality is like bubbles in an ocean, connected yet separate, and upon death, these bubbles merge back into the whole."
110,109959,"The individual began by inhaling vaporized material through a water pipe, experiencing an immediate onset of effects. They reported feeling as though they were ""blasting off"" while holding onto the armrest of a chair to stay grounded. Visuals were kaleidoscopic and enveloping, with patterns replicating around the room and colors forming pools beneath them.

The experience then shifted into what felt like another dimension, characterized by an eerie white expanse and tinnitus-like ringing in their ears. An alien presence was perceived as aware of the individual's entry into this world, causing fear due to its non-human intelligence. The landscape transformed into a colorful, prismatic environment with pyramid-like structures.

A complex geometric structure resembling a face or head emerged, growing in detail and complexity. It contained Aztec-like patterns and elements such as feathers, diamonds, and snake-like phalanges. The individual felt consumed by this structure before returning to the physical world.

Upon comedown, they were greeted by music playing on an iPhone and friends strumming guitars, which provided a gentle welcome back with a somber yet truthful tone."
111,110091,"The participant begins their journey with an initial dose and gradually increases it until they are thrust into an alien dimension. This world is composed of geometric structures in vibrant colors and lacks the constraints of three-dimensional space. The participant feels warmth and relaxation, exploring this landscape for hours before brief glimpses of reality return.

As night falls in this realm, the participant encounters immense darkness and five humanoid figures with razor-sharp teeth that attack relentlessly from below. They endure this terror for an extended period until light returns. On subsequent days, they encounter non-corporeal beings that offer empathy and support during their ordeal. However, as night falls again, these entities leave, and the participant is attacked by tendrils of darkness that infect their thoughts with negativity.

The third day brings a sense of unease as the participant questions whether this experience will end or if they are trapped forever. Nightfall brings another terrifying encounter with the same monstrosities. On the fourth night, the participant experiences ego death, which helps them cope with the situation by eliminating self-awareness and emotions.

The final three days and nights pass in a similar manner, but without the emotional impact of ego death. The participant's sense of self gradually returns on the seventh day, accompanied by periodic flashes of reality that become more frequent until they are fully back in their familiar environment after 15 minutes."
112,98050,"The participant began their experience by inhaling smoke from a glass pipe, which rapidly transported them into an altered state of consciousness. They first encountered a room transformed into a cartoon-like, oil-painted version of their actual bedroom. As the effects intensified, they found themselves in a space resembling the base of a tower with stairs ascending around the edge. A being resembling the character from UNKLE album covers observed them as they traveled through this space.

After passing through various dimensions within a wooden chair-like structure, the participant entered a vast area containing a crystalline lake and clouds forming into the head of Buddha or Vishnu. The entity in this form communicated gently, suggesting that the participant was not ready to learn anything during this experience. Following this, they experienced an undulating sea of chrome colors and shapes before gradually returning to reality.

Throughout the journey, the participant maintained awareness of their girlfriend's presence but did not interact with her directly until near the end when they reached out for her hand."
113,88607,"The participant prepared a white substance by scraping it from a polished stainless steel pan and loosely filled a glass bong bowl about halfway. After inhaling the vaporized substance, they experienced immediate changes in color perception and texture of objects. Their hand appeared to have an iridescent outer layer. They took another hit after thirty seconds, which was harsher due to burning it too quickly.

On the third inhalation with a fuller dose, the participant entered a vivid state characterized by tunnels made of rotating cobalt blue spheres and then found themselves in a geometric world framed in red, black, and silver. The experience lasted about ten minutes but felt timeless. They alternated between awareness of their surroundings and immersion in the digital-like world.

Feeling trapped in this alternate reality, they tried to reconnect with reality by touching the ceiling and calling out to their dog Walter. Holding onto Walter provided comfort and helped them return to normal consciousness. During this process, the participant experienced closed-eye visuals of a fusion between their soul and the dog's biological processes, which were harmonious with his heartbeat.

The trip concluded with the participant hugging Walter and feeling an intense connection to him. Upon returning to reality, they felt as if they had just returned from another dimension and laughed for about an hour reflecting on the experience."
114,108548,"The participant began their experience in complete darkness, inhaling three consecutive hits of a substance without breathing air between them. They felt suffocated but reminded themselves they were fine. A dozen green hands appeared, swirling with index fingers pointed upwards, signaling the participant to stop talking and pay attention. 

A male entity, described as sage-green and resembling a circus ringmaster, instructed the participant to watch. The scene included a bus, a pink and orange high-rise building with balconies featuring beings engaged in playful but serious simulated sex acts. These beings had pointy faces and were looking at the participant.

The guide led the participant around the back of the bus into another room where they encountered a tall woman wearing blue robes or a gown who glowed brightly. She invited the participant to paint, which was declined due to lack of skill. The experience lasted approximately 20 minutes, with the participant feeling physically normal after one hour but mentally affected for an extended period."
115,86700,"The participant began by smoking a substance in a dimly lit room with their boyfriend. As the effects set in, the room appeared to melt and transform into clay-like visuals. The participant then closed their eyes and felt their energy rise, leading them to an alternate reality where they encountered people dressed in ancient attire.

In this new environment, the participant observed various activities such as sweeping and writing but was unable to interact directly with these entities. They were pulled through a series of colorful rooms before returning to their boyfriend's presence. The couple cuddled, kissed, and experienced physical sensations together while visuals of beautiful colors continued.

The participant then encountered millions of pinkish-purple entities surrounding them. One entity stayed close throughout the experience, touching both the participant and her boyfriend simultaneously. This interaction resulted in a non-sexual orgasmic sensation for the participant. As the effects began to wane, the participant expressed their feelings to their boyfriend and mentioned a desire to vomit, which they suppressed out of respect."
116,88112,"The participant experienced an intense alteration of consciousness after using a substance. They felt as though every atom in their body dispersed rapidly across the universe, perceiving everything in high resolution. The environment was filled with intricate lattice structures representing celestial creation. Eventually, they encountered what they described as the Source, an infinite flat plane that rippled and shimmered, birthing realities.

Upon returning to normal consciousness, the participant felt exhausted but also experienced a period of heightened beauty and peace in everyday life. However, this state was short-lived as they struggled to communicate with others who were preoccupied with mundane topics. The experience left them feeling disconnected from societal norms and values, leading to an increased awareness of suffering and injustice.

The participant now finds it difficult to engage with the world around them due to a perceived lack of shared understanding and purpose."
117,99091,"The participant had three experiences with a substance. The first attempt resulted in visual distortions but no significant detachment from reality. On the second try, they felt their mind detach slightly from their body, observing faint rainbow halos around objects. For the final trip, they consumed a larger amount and experienced a brief period of altered consciousness characterized by being in an alien place with geometric structures. They reported feeling disconnected from their physical body during this time but returned to normalcy after a few minutes. The experience did not provide spiritual insights or creative breakthroughs as previously experienced with other substances."
118,108349,"The participant smoked an extract containing DMT and cannabis while sitting by a river with a waterfall nearby. Upon inhalation, they experienced rapid onset visual hallucinations characterized by intense colors and complex shapes. A machine-like living object moved over them, cleaning their body, mind, and soul, preparing them for the presence of light-dwelling entities.

The participant communicated telepathically with these entities, which were described as having a bee essence and compound eyes similar to flies. The experience was compared to meeting royalty, emphasizing the importance of preparation before entering their presence fully. After this encounter, the participant returned to partial consciousness while still experiencing altered visual perceptions of nature and fabric.

A second attempt was made after a half-hour break, but due to insufficient DMT in the remaining extract, the experience was brief with only a short interaction with bee-like light entities."
119,89758,"The participant began their experience by smoking a substance in their bedroom while watching ""Lord of the Rings."" They immediately felt a buzzing sensation in their head and decided to keep their eyes open during the trip. A presence was sensed on their left side, which directed them towards the TV screen. The sky and clouds moved towards the foreground, engulfing the snowy mountains and characters until the entire screen was filled with the background.

Next, the participant looked up at the ceiling and observed intricate lattice-like designs swirling in layers, seemingly extending infinitely into space. They felt this pattern resembled a gateway to the heavens. The presence then directed their attention to the top right corner of the room where they saw a dark shadow casting within the glow of the TV. This figure did not feel negative but was watching and analyzing them.

As the experience began to wane, the participant glanced back at the TV one last time, noticing Frodo and Gandalf's heads reappearing in the foreground as the sky slowly returned to its original position."
120,96437,"The participant began their experience after inhaling a substance from a pipe containing marijuana as a base. They reported seeing the pipe transform into a cartoon-like appearance before entering what they described as a wormhole. An Asian lady was visible and seemed to push them down into this tunnel.

During the journey, the participant experienced kaleidoscope colors and heard pinging and bell sounds. They encountered multiple barriers during their descent, each time receiving instructions from voices guiding them through these phases. In one phase, an egg yolk-like substance engulfed their face. The participant felt physical sensations such as bowel and bladder release but was instructed to spit.

After several cycles of the same experience, they were pulled into a new world by multiple hands. This realm appeared vibrant with confetti-like light shards flying everywhere. Friends around them had different hues, and everything looked waxy and glossy. They regained some control over their physical body in this phase, managing to talk and ask for water and a cigarette.

The participant was brought back inside and seated on a couch made of leather breasts with faces. A girl hugged the participant, breathing on them and rubbing their faces together, providing warmth and comfort. Music played in the background.

During the trip, the participant lost physical control and engaged in behaviors such as hugging plants, scraping knees and arms, eating dirt, and diving out a door onto concrete. These actions were observed by friends but not remembered by the participant until recounted later.

The entire experience from first hit to sobriety lasted approximately 30 minutes."
121,91490,"The participant began their experience by inhaling a substance through a glass pipe prepared by their sitter. They experienced an initial buzzing sound about halfway into the inhalation process, followed by visual hallucinations of yellow objects under their eyes as they lay down on the air mattress. The participant felt a twitch on the left side of their face and then entered what they described as ""the trip of my life.""

Upon opening their eyes (or believing them to be open), they saw branches of oak trees rustling and swaying downward, appearing alive and detached from the trunks. The leaves looked like goblins with pointed heads and horns, zooming towards or into the participant at high speed. Initially terrified, the participant then began enjoying what felt like a baptism or initiation.

The participant experienced intense heat and chest congestion during the trip. They asked for water and noticed their sitter appeared very distorted when they tried to look at them. Closing their eyes again, they saw yellow visuals but were more focused on rich and extraordinary auditory experiences. The participant heard a conversation between nearby campers as if inside their head, followed by static before returning to normal hearing.

After the experience, everything returned to normal for the participant."
122,89661,"The participant experienced a brief but vivid psychedelic episode after consuming an unknown substance. Initially, there was no effect from three small hits, but upon taking a larger hit and holding it in for longer, they felt their consciousness being pushed out of their body before quickly returning. With eyes closed, the participant saw beautiful geometric shapes in warm colors that pulsed and danced.

When opening their eyes, Sam appeared as a colorful, fragmented image, resembling a paint-by-number artwork. The room's blankets and socks also displayed vivid, happy colors. The experience was accompanied by an internal dialogue between two parts of the brain: one rational and seeking stability, the other urging to let go and embrace the sensations.

The participant observed their hands in intricate detail, almost as if seeing through layers of skin into tendons, vessels, and bones. This observation was not scary but rather interesting and beautiful. Sam's smile indicated his happiness at the participant's enjoyment of the experience. The trip lasted approximately 7 minutes before a gradual comedown."
123,99870,"The individual began their trip in a positive mindset after waking from a dream about personal growth and independence. They consumed an unspecified substance, which led to intense and overwhelming sensations. Initially, they felt confused but then embraced the experience as part of a larger narrative about life being a story. The participant experienced electric surges of energy and dissolved boundaries, feeling woven into existence.

Visuals included fractal patterns on walls, morphing woodwork into complex beings, and DMT-like frame-shifting effects. They listened to two songs, 'System 700' by Younger Brother and 'Smokey Taboo' by CocoRosie, which evoked abstract thoughts about spirit journeys and emotional connections.

The individual then consumed another substance, leading to three hits of a second unspecified drug. During this phase, they experienced rapid synesthetic sensations, academic-themed visuals, and an overwhelming sense of non-duality. Upon coming down from the experience, they observed unusual carpet movements and continued with DMT-like visual effects.

Overall, the trip was characterized by intense emotional and sensory experiences, philosophical reflections, and interactions with abstract imagery."
124,98522,"The individual began their experience in a recreational room with friends after smoking a substance that caused intense visual and auditory hallucinations. They felt an overwhelming sense of intensity and were pulled into another dimension through the ceiling. In this new environment, they encountered a benevolent entity that transformed into a shape-shifting tree filled with millions of eyeballs connected by fleshy veins and arteries that morphed into wooden branches. The participant also saw billions of cells constantly moving in an intricate pattern.

After some time, the individual began to come down from the experience, floating back through the ceiling hole and rejoining their physical body on a couch. Upon regaining consciousness, they felt intense pressure but eventually returned to baseline after about 30 minutes."
125,96607,"The participant arrived at an event around 5:00pm and ingested a substance at 9:00pm. They experienced nausea initially but then began to feel strange sensations. Visual patterns resembling Alex Grey paintings appeared when they closed their eyes, and the bass from music seemed amplified. The participant felt as though God was communicating with them, advising them to speak only intelligently.

They visited restrooms where a man washing his hands appeared to be creating intricate hand art. While walking back to the stage area, they encountered P who performed a dance-like wave goodbye, which amused the participant and their companion V. The participant felt compelled to hug trees and plants as if they were people.

Inside a large white dome with moving holographic projections, the participant experienced intense emotions, including laughter and tears. They believed they could sense psychic abilities and attempted to answer questions posed by others in the group. One question about 2012 was answered with a prediction of greater understanding and acceptance among people.

The participant saw trails of light from hands and bodies on the dance floor and sensed V's sadness, offering a hug. They also interacted with A, calling him ""V's twin"" due to forgetfulness. During the New Year countdown, they hugged and kissed V.

Back at the car, the participant noticed blue spirit lights around V and discussed the concept of all religions being one. They passed by K again who inquired about their feelings for V, leading to further discussion about relationships and personal purpose. The participant believed their role was to absorb information like a flower and spread knowledge.

Inside the car, they talked more with V about personal matters such as family connections and emotional well-being. Visual effects included snowflake patterns on grass, stars forming a lattice around Earth, and fireworks appearing sparkling and beautiful. Text seemed to move, and there were instances of double vision where some people appeared to have multiple eyes or chins.

They returned to the psytrance stage where they saw someone painting intricate artwork and recognized them from online. The participant felt sleepy and went back to V's car to sleep. They woke up after sunrise when music had been shut down by police but soon resumed. Later, E, P, V, Y, and the participant smoked a substance with no effects for two of them."
126,91911,"The participant began their journey with DMT by experiencing a grey entity that touched them through their forehead, leading to an ego death experience. They felt humbled and gained insights about their spiritual path and the importance of letting go of doubts and embracing full faith. The next day, while watching a movie, they had another powerful psychedelic experience characterized by intense emotions and a realization about the nature of happiness and sadness.

In subsequent DMT sessions, the participant saw visions of a person from their workplace, leading to reflections on race relations and personal biases. They also encountered entities that engaged in sexual interactions with them, which helped clarify their understanding of sexuality and relationships. The experiences were accompanied by physical sensations and emotional responses, providing insights into their personal growth and self-awareness."
127,94941,"The participant attended a party after a music event and consumed multiple substances over several hours. They started with coca paste, which produced talkative and happy feelings but also some body discomfort. Following this, they took DOB, leading to sleepiness and then a gradual onset of psychedelic effects when combined with mushrooms later in the evening.

The mushroom experience intensified visual phenomena such as fractal patterns, color changes, and depth perception. The participant reported feeling childlike and innocent during this phase. They also experienced body load and nausea but remained functional. While tripping, they engaged in activities like watching television and interacting with others at the party.

Nitrous oxide was used intermittently throughout the experience, enhancing visual effects and creating a sense of warmth and comfort. The participant then consumed MDMA, which intensified their feelings of love and connection to those around them. They experienced strong body load and intense visuals, including fractal patterns and kaleidoscopic imagery.

A shaman-like figure interacted with the participant during this phase, explaining concepts related to energy and auras. The participant reported seeing colors corresponding to chakras when asked about them by the shaman. This interaction was described as immersive and trippy.

The experience peaked with DMT, which produced intense tunnel vision and kaleidoscopic visuals. The participant felt disconnected from reality during this phase but eventually recovered. They continued to feel effects of DOB for an extended period, experiencing waves of psychedelic intensity and a sense of timelessness.

Throughout the night, the participant engaged in conversations with others at the party, maintaining good vibes despite their intense trip. They also had interactions with animals like a cat, feeling strong affection towards it during the MDMA phase. The experience concluded around 3 PM the next day, leaving the participant with profound insights and a changed perspective on drug use."
128,87761,"The participant began their experience by ingesting a substance and felt an initial change that was both energizing and relaxing. With closed eyes, they experienced vivid visual patterns typical of HPPD (hallucinogen persisting perception disorder). They heard many voices and felt telepathically connected to others.

During the peak, the participant reported feeling enlightened, experiencing moments of ego death, and a deep appreciation for their body and surroundings. They perceived objects as entities with their own consciousness and engaged in philosophical musings about existence, interconnectedness, and collective consciousness.

The experience took a turn where the participant felt cold and disoriented, leading to wandering behavior outside. There were concerns about safety due to impaired judgment and difficulty focusing on tasks. The participant also experienced some anxiety related to potential negative impacts of their actions on others.

Upon returning inside, they engaged in repetitive behaviors like walking in circles and had interactions with objects and media that seemed meaningful during the trip. They briefly considered smoking an additional dose but decided against it due to concerns about unforeseen consequences.

As the experience began to wane, the participant felt more coherent and engaged in activities such as playing chess and spinning poi, experiencing vivid tracers and a return of blissful feelings. The night concluded with reflection on the experience and appreciation for life."
129,90895,"The author sat in a loft with friends discussing hallucinogens when they decided to try a powerful substance. They snorted a line and immediately felt intense visual distortions and an out-of-body sensation. The room appeared to breathe and morph, and colors became brighter and more vivid. As the effects intensified, the participant's body seemed to melt away, and they entered a dark yet vibrant world filled with lights and colors.

In this altered state, the author encountered entities that took on various forms, including fractal patterns and flowers. These beings guided the participant towards an apex in their visual field. The experience was accompanied by physical discomfort, such as nausea and difficulty breathing. After about 10 minutes, the participant retreated to a dark room where they continued to see vivid open-eyed visuals of wires and mechanical clockwork.

The entities reappeared and continued to beckon the author into their realm. Fifteen minutes in, the participant felt ready for the experience to end but was reluctant to return to reality. They called out for assistance from a friend who entered the room, bringing light and helping them transition back to normal consciousness."
130,89910,"The individual began their experience after inhaling a substance through a water pipe, experiencing initial discomfort before entering an altered state of consciousness characterized by heightened visual perception and vivid hallucinations. Colors appeared brighter and objects vibrated independently with a tinted film overlaying them. Closing their eyes revealed intricate patterns resembling chrysanthemums or writhing worms in neon colors.

The participant then entered a visionary state, finding themselves in a round room with red and orange walls that subtly changed appearance. Seated at a table was a humanoid figure with a horse-like head and tentacles emerging from the bottom of its face. This being offered an object to the participant, which appeared as a writhing mass similar to the initial hallucination. The being extruded this object in a manner combining breathing, vomiting, and singing.

The room contained other beings engaged in a ritual where each received an object from the central figure. These entities did not acknowledge the participant, leading them to speculate if they were sharing a body with one of these beings or if it was a shared psychedelic experience among multiple people. The objects given by the central being were ingested by the others without diminishing in size.

The participant remained stunned and observed the scene until the experience concluded through an auditory vibration that brought them back to their physical body. Upon opening their eyes, they found themselves still experiencing heightened visual perception but returned to normal consciousness after a few minutes."
131,87967,"The participant began their experience by consuming a small amount of a substance and then smoking another substance. They reported that the room vibrated initially but soon saw everything composed of pulsing, rainbow-colored lines forming complex geometric designs. These patterns eventually took on a loose form resembling Buddha, who communicated with the participant in an unspoken manner. The Buddha entity conveyed concepts related to awareness, kindness, detachment from desire, and the dhamma.

The participant then explored various environments including pyramids where they encountered Charlie from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" surrounded by gold, ancient Celtic times as a druid, and a deep cavern representing Welsh mythology. In this cavern, they fell into another space resembling the cave from ""The Hobbit,"" where they found a ring and interacted with Gollum. The interaction with Gollum involved answering riddles that were actually questions about their subconscious mind, particularly regarding how to deal with individuals who lack conscience.

During this process, the participant realized that Gollum represented a negative counterpart to an idealized version of themselves, symbolizing fear and the need for balance. They concluded that achieving rebirth and realizing the fourth jhana required detaching from the desire for life and accepting the possibility of death.

The experience ended abruptly after these realizations were made."
132,73648,"The participants experienced an intense psychedelic trip after smoking ""Changa"" in a dimly lit room with incense burning and music playing. They smoked their portions separately but shared the experience. Upon inhalation, the first participant rapidly entered a trance state characterized by vivid geometric patterns of light and color that seemed to have order and meaning.

The visuals included abstract mandalas and plasma-like formations of bright light. The participant attempted vocalization during the peak, producing sounds that corresponded with visual changes in synesthetic fashion. However, the intensity was overwhelming, leading them to lie down and let their mind soar through these hallucinations.

Compared to pure DMT, this experience felt more grounded and earthy, with less fear and a gentler fade-off. The afterglow left the participant content, dreamy, and with heightened senses of touch. The girlfriend also had a deep and beautiful experience, which was enhanced by playing didgeridoo sounds.

The next day, smoking residual Changa produced less intense but still beautiful effects, transforming plant life and clouds into living jewels. Both participants were impressed with the experience, noting its pleasant afterglow and visual richness."
133,70877,"The participant experienced intense visual patterns upon inhaling an unknown substance. Initially overwhelmed by fractal-like visuals, they closed their eyes and encountered a two-dimensional face resembling a Buddha with an elongated cranium and iridescent shifting colors. This being was perceived as benevolent. The participant then entered a corridor of geometry-defying cubes filled with vibrant, shifting colors.

The experience became too intense to bear, so the participant opened their eyes. They saw iridescent patterns covering everything in view, including windows displaying the face and a tree that transformed into walking faces. A friend appeared adorned in an iridescent chrysanthemum pattern. The visuals gradually faded, leaving the participant with a sense of clarity and awe."
134,83785,"The experience began in a forest setting during an electronic music festival. Four individuals smoked Jungle DMT, which is pure alkaloid extract of Mimosa hostilis root bark. The first participant, Stan, experienced intense visuals and sensations after inhaling the substance. He reported feeling like he was on a roller coaster ride and exhibited physical reactions such as deep breathing and hand movements.

The second participant inhaled more of the substance and experienced fractal patterns spreading outwards from their core while breathing in and contracting towards their core while exhaling. They also saw kaleidoscopic patterns in the trees and felt a strong connection to nature, particularly the earth. The third participant, Dean, reported seeing fairies in a piece of bark and experiencing high-pitched, high-frequency vibrations.

All four participants arranged themselves in a square on the ground, holding hands, meditating, and sharing energy with each other and the forest around them. One female participant did not experience any psychedelic effects despite taking multiple hits; she broke down crying instead. The group discussed that her resistance to the drug's effects manifested as repressed emotion.

After the experience, the participants were in a pleasant afterglow state, combining residual DMT and acid effects with hash smoking."
135,79622,"The individual began their experience at a party where they inhaled a small amount of an unidentified substance along with cannabis. They noticed vivid visuals, including graffiti that seemed significant and moving cracks in the floor forming figures. A week later, they used a larger dose alone, experiencing immediate visual changes and disorientation.

Upon inhaling the substance, the participant felt as if their world turned black and heard a ringing sound inside their head. They perceived themselves as a small orb where their brain was located and experienced intense heat. The carpet beneath them transformed into a rural farm scene with neat plots of land. Their arms appeared to disintegrate before reappearing alive.

A friend entered the room, and in the participant's peripheral vision, this person's head turned into multiple black hands weaving together. The wooden sculpture of a couple hugging morphed into one of their friends. As the experience concluded, the participant felt reborn with altered perceptions."
136,77550,"The participant began their experience by taking three doses of a substance. After the first dose, they noticed enhanced patterns in surfaces, particularly wood grains that appeared to flow with golden hues resembling electron movement through a wire. The carpet depth seemed to increase and resembled a slowly moving brook filled with swimming shapes.

Upon the second dose, the carpet's depth doubled, and wall hangings began to display dynamic visual effects reminiscent of suns radiating energy. Objects in the room gained unusual depth, both away from and towards the observer.

After the third dose, while eyes closed, the participant encountered several figures, including five Egyptian-like sculptures visible only from the waist down with a diamond checkerboard pattern that moved constantly. A larger darker figure was also present, which the participant perceived as their representation of self. The visual field included complex geometric patterns and mandalas.

The experience involved an infinity of intermeshed gears turning away, described as beautiful. Upon opening eyes, the room's decorations appeared to emit energy like galaxies forming with rainbows surrounding everything. Vision had a slight delay, and various faces swarmed and morphed around, disappearing quickly.

After about five minutes, the participant called for assistance, still experiencing vivid visual effects but capable of discussing their experience after some time. The mood was described as shitty five hours later, likely due to the intensity of the trip."
137,74289,"The participant prepared for a 60mg dose of DMT by setting up a quiet room with dim lighting and earplugs to block out external noises. They smoked the substance using a meth pipe and immediately felt its effects. Shortly after inhaling, they experienced an intense visual and auditory hallucination where they were surrounded by colorful, pulsating beings in a bright environment.

These entities communicated with the participant in what seemed like a musical language, conveying complex information that inspired them to create music. The experience was described as enlightening and familiar, with the beings appearing pleased to see the participant. As the trip progressed, the vividness of the hallucinations began to fade, and the participant found themselves back in their dark room, confused by the sudden change.

After the initial confusion, the participant noticed lingering visual effects such as swirling patterns on surfaces. They felt a strong urge to remain seated and reflect on what had happened during the trip. The participants' nostrils stung due to exhaling through them during the experience."
138,75162,"The participant inhaled a substance through a pipe and immediately felt visual and auditory distortions. The experience rapidly intensified, leading to vivid hallucinations of colorful geometric patterns and entities made entirely of light. These feminine beings were present in a room that appeared to be a machine with bright purples and golds. One entity showed the participant a small machine-like object containing an orange liquid that broke into segments. As the effects began to subside, the visions gradually became less intense, transitioning to swirling geometric shapes made of bright lights and colors. The participant experienced lingering visual disturbances and intense emotions as they came down from the experience."
139,62911,"The individual starts experiencing intense physical sensations, including a feeling of their body being stretched thin and moving rapidly through space. They then enter a state where they perceive intricate geometric shapes that defy conventional geometry and physics. These shapes are colorful and move in an organized manner, suggesting underlying order. The participant also hears divine music without identifiable timbre.

As the experience progresses, the individual's sense of self begins to develop, allowing them to interact with their environment. They can now see familiar shapes and hear recognizable sounds, though everything is still highly vivid and beautiful. The participant explores the world tactilely, feeling intense pleasure from simple interactions like touching grass or branches.

The sense of self further develops, enabling the individual to engage in social interaction. They meet another person who is also laughing and share their experiences. As the experience continues, the participant's ability to make aesthetic judgments improves rapidly. Towards the end, a sense of prudence emerges, leading to more reflective discussions about the nature of reality, books, meditation, rationality, and mysticism."
140,73400,"The participant experienced an intense psychedelic trip after smoking an unspecified substance at a friend's birthday party. The experience began with visual distortions, such as the brick wall turning into a flowing game of tetris with vibrant colors and intricate designs. As the effects intensified, the surroundings transformed into a room covered in elaborate geometric patterns and neon lines. People nearby appeared as flat, spiraling color forms.

The participant noted that sound seemed to slow down and eventually stop entirely, creating an impression of suspended animation while they remained aware and mobile. This state lasted for about 30 seconds before gradually fading back to normal perception over a few minutes. Throughout the experience, the individual felt comfortable and in control, knowing it was due to the substance and that friends were present."
141,70549,"The individual experienced intense physical sensations such as pain in the neck, jaw, lymph nodes, and inner ear, along with a feeling that the body has layers or is hollow inside. Visual effects included dancing visuals, distinct patterns, and colors without red or gold tones. The participant felt as though they were moving from room to room while watching visual laces and motifs. There was also a sense of being underwater or under pressure.

The experience involved confusion about sensory inputs, where sounds, smells, and visuals became indistinguishable. The individual perceived the construction of various objects layer by layer, including noises, ear sensations, couches, lamps, carpets, walls, wind on windows, airplanes, breathing, moments in time, and more. After the experience, the participant reported pain in their face and brain but found it worthwhile."
142,65093,"The participant began their experience by sitting comfortably on a blue tile floor in an empty office room. They took two hits from a makeshift pipe using a lighter. After the second hit, they felt tactile sensations and experienced what they described as a ""soul ascent,"" feeling pulled upwards by a divine force.

As this occurred, the ground beneath them began to shake and break apart into pieces of blue tile. The participant fell through these shards until reaching a white light with a swirling darkness in its center. Upon landing on water that reflected the light above like a mirror, they observed an unusual sky covered in eight-sided shapes resembling diamonds, which changed colors and seemed to contain galaxies within them.

The ripples in the water spoke to the participant, asking where they would go. The participant then focused on one of these shapes, feeling their body connect with a higher soul as if plunging into it at light speed. This led to traveling through a tunnel of changing shapes before emerging into what appeared to be a cluster of stars connected by lines of crystal-clear material.

The participant felt a connection between their mind and this wall of ""pieces of creation,"" experiencing everything becoming bright and unable to close their eyes. They then attempted to move but found difficulty, eventually standing up after taking deep breaths. The experience left them feeling high but not smiling, with some objects in the room behaving unusually."
143,57936,"The participant experienced an immersive visual journey after inhaling vaporized substance through a homemade pipe. Initially, they perceived rippling patterns of multi-colored fractals, primarily in hues of purple and gold. They reported feeling numb and heavy but overall pleasant and euphoric. During the experience, they encountered young female entities dressed in vibrant rave attire who beckoned them through corridors.

The participant's auditory perception was altered; sounds echoed as if inside a stainless steel vessel, making it difficult to understand spoken words. The silence during this period felt profound and unique. As the peak subsided, upon opening their eyes, everything appeared made of shimmering liquid material, including their girlfriend who seemed semi-fluid like mercury. The Persian carpet on the floor was alive with rippling colors.

The experience lasted about 45 minutes in total, with a significant portion spent alternating between open and closed-eyed visuals. They found this to be an extraordinary visual experience compared to previous psychedelic trips. Afterward, they felt slightly exhausted but eager for another session. The next day, the participant experienced throat soreness and an acrid taste reminiscent of mothballs."
144,57450,"The participant vaporized an off-white crystal substance from a glass pipe, consuming approximately 20-30mg of it in four hits. Visual distortions began after closing their eyes, characterized by vibrant colors similar to neon lights or psychedelic art. The visuals included intricate patterns and hieroglyphics on walls within what appeared to be a castle-like structure.

A woman with punk aesthetics appeared, flipping the participant off and taunting them. She showed a glowing blue neuron-like object before being ignored as the participant focused on visualizing a mandala that morphed into an Aztec calendar. The environment was described as 4-dimensional, with objects appearing mostly 2D and resembling translucent acetate sheets.

The experience felt superficial despite its intensity, similar to a fast-paced video game or VR world. After about five minutes, the participant began coming down, experiencing full-body shaking and yawning. Upon opening their eyes, faint op-art patterns were visible on walls and ceilings. The participant noted wanting to explore this new world more deeply in future experiences."
145,47094,"The participant reported experiencing vibrant, transforming colors and intricate geometric patterns that enveloped their vision. They felt a sense of merging with these patterns until they perceived themselves as part of an unfolding chrysanthemum-like structure. This led to what was described as an unimaginable ascent into another realm.

In this new environment, the scenery was overlaid by millions of tiny vibrating cubes, each producing distinct sounds upon vibration. Two male entities appeared, both wearing elaborate eyewear or goggles that conveyed their status as fashionable in their dimension. These entities engaged in a competition to impress the participant with increasingly complex and visually stunning displays projected into the sky.

The encounter ended when the participant felt overwhelmed by the beauty of these displays, at which point they were drawn back from this experience."
146,24161,"At 8pm on a warm summer evening, the participant smoked a substance and immediately felt disconnected from their surroundings. They experienced vivid geometric shapes in 3D vision, interlocked and flowing gracefully with droplets of various colors within them. Initially, they felt choking and believed they were dying, leading to panic as they had no point of reference other than this visual experience.

Gradually, the participant became accustomed to the state and started questioning their identity. They heard a soft hum similar to a distant waterfall and regained awareness of their hands, which caused ripples in the geometric shapes. After about 12 minutes, the participant opened their eyes to an orange-tinted world and felt nervous but returned to normal within an hour."
147,19216,"Three individuals participated in a multi-day camping trip where they consumed an unidentified substance and experienced vivid hallucinations. On their first night, each person took several inhalations from a pipe containing the substance and then used nitrous oxide to enhance the effects. 

Butch's experience began with intricate patterns of light forming on a dark background. After inhaling nitrous oxide, he saw rapidly changing, complex patterns that formed into walls and columns. He observed a Mayan-like head in the sky from which strands of colored light extended towards him. As the substance wore off, Butch returned to seeing orange patterns against a black background. In his final attempt, he experienced an explosion of gold and red patterned lights after taking multiple hits. During this experience, he felt observed by multiple beings before encountering an elephant-headed creature that briefly interacted with him using its trunk.

SunDance's first experience involved being surrounded by dark red and black geometric squares with familiar eyes from previous trips. He then saw an oval image of Aztec codes and ancient shamans, followed by a feeling of empowerment. After taking more of the substance, he entered a world of white light where large segmented worm-like figures appeared. These beings acknowledged him before disappearing. SunDance also experienced a vision of a translucent Ganesh-octopus figure colored in red and gold dots rising from the earth into space. He felt protected by this image but could not communicate with it directly. Later, he saw Northwest Indian-style pictographs flipping through his mind, focusing on images of salmon which seemed important to remember.

Cisco's experience started with being in a chamber of bright yellow patterned walls that reminded him of a carnival. The second hit showed the same patterns framed by a bamboo triangle that fell away like pages from a book. He felt watched by an unseen group or family. On his third attempt, he experienced fear as his soul was seemingly ripped from his body and he lost sense of identity. However, with each breath, the patterned light changed, and he regained composure. He noticed bright red designs within the larger patterns before the experience faded.

The next day, SunDance tried snorting a small amount of the substance, which caused intense visual effects including increased color vibrancy and glowing scenes. The final night's experience was less strong but featured a long dark tunnel with geometric patterns and watching eyes."
148,20727,"The participant began by inhaling a small amount of substance through a glass pipe. They experienced an immediate physical sensation followed by visual hallucinations characterized by rapidly changing multi-colored geometric patterns. A brief encounter with an entity occurred, described as a female face with lifelike eyes that appeared independent from the user's ego. The entity was not present when the participant opened their eyes again. The effects lasted approximately seven minutes before fading."
149,12306,"The participant was alone at home in the afternoon when they consumed a substance through smoking. Within minutes, they entered an altered state characterized by vivid, colorful geometric patterns. They felt a strong sense of connection to other beings who had experienced this state before, though no individual people were seen or heard. The experience included what the participant described as an additional sensory field beyond normal senses, possibly involving telepathy and genetic memory.

After about five minutes, the altered state began to fade. Upon returning to their usual consciousness, the participant reflected on the loss of accumulated knowledge from such experiences due to societal attitudes towards consciousness-altering substances. They expressed a desire for widespread access to this experience, believing it could lead to greater understanding and acceptance.

The overall experience was described as positive with beautiful visual effects and a sense of connection to transcendent levels of consciousness. The participant returned to normal within 20 minutes."
150,1858,"Zarkov and Gracie took mushrooms together after Zarkov had consumed DMT earlier in the day. While Gracie did not see any visions, Zarkov entered a trance-like state characterized by vivid imagery. Initially, he saw hostile insectoid creatures but was reassured by accompanying ""banshee"" entities that these creatures could not harm him.

Zarkov then encountered various aliens attempting to sell him different visions, with the banshees continuing to provide commentary throughout his experience. The house experienced poltergeist phenomena during this time, which Zarkov's companion and their cats observed.

At a peak point in the trip, Zarkov found himself transported to another world that appeared real and detailed. This world was described as a bronze-age city with neoclassical architecture and inhabited by voluptuous nymphos. Zarkov was dressed in an elaborate outfit and accompanied by a group of long-haired individuals.

The narrative of this world involved a tour through the city culminating in a three-day orgy at the main temple. The experience lasted for what felt like days but occurred within the timeframe of a typical mushroom trip. The banshees were present throughout, though disguised as bats or orchids, and provided commentary on Zarkov's journey.

The world had its own internal rules and linear time, allowing Zarkov to interact with it naturally. He could eat, walk, swim, and communicate within this environment. The experience was described as coherent and consistent, suggesting that the fantasy world may have been lifted from Gracie's mind and placed in a shared ""library of all time and space."""
151,118430,"The user began their experience by inhaling 25mg of freebase DMT using a vaporizer while listening to music in their bedroom. At around one minute into the trip, they noticed that the curtains had transformed into a murky forest scene with pale green light shining through what appeared to be trees formed on the darker folds of the fabric.

By two minutes in, colorful prismatic lights resembling will o' the wisps started moving through this forest-like curtain. Around three minutes later, abstract faces began forming in the trees, which resembled more intricate versions of Louis Wain's later paintings of cats. These spirits moved around and some stopped to watch the user, who did not feel afraid.

The experience peaked between five and seven minutes, with the user laughing manically due to awe at the visuals and their successful DMT consumption without coughing or additional help. The music played during the trip sounded slowed and distorted, but the user's focus remained on the forest scene.

At nine minutes in, the curtain appeared liquid-like, as if reflecting a pool of water. The fabric felt grainier than usual when touched, and the carpet texture intensified under the user's fingers. By ten minutes, the forest had faded, leaving behind the curtains with enhanced color intensity typical of other psychedelic experiences.

The trip began to subside between twelve and fifteen minutes, resulting in mild euphoria and minor visual distortions similar to the early stages of an LSD or psilocybin experience. The music continued to sound distorted. By twenty minutes post-consumption, very minor effects remained, including excitement, relaxation, and slight trembling.

Half an hour later, a mild headache developed alongside lingering euphoria, reminiscent of a low-dose MDMA experience."
152,85245,"The participant began by snorting an amount of the substance that would result in a moderately strong experience if vaporized. This first attempt resulted in a mild psychedelic experience lasting around an hour. The next day, they doubled the dose and experienced more intense effects. Physical sensations included a burning nose and eyes which subsided after a few minutes. They noticed their body hair moving like tiny snakes or tentacles.

About 20 minutes into the trip, the participant's skin turned golden, droplets of water on white plastic walls appeared pink, and patterns emerged from the walls, moving towards them. Closing their eyes revealed distinct visions including a woman with her back turned. The experience lasted approximately 45 minutes to an hour."
153,116659,"The participant began the day feeling fatigued and in pain, deciding to use a small dose of DMT which alleviated their discomfort. Later, they consumed mushrooms to address emotional distress related to their daughter's addiction issues. About two hours into the mushroom experience, around 5 PM, they used another dose of DMT.

During this second DMT experience, the participant felt a strong sense of dread and believed they were dead. They saw a graveyard scene with tombstones before everything faded to black, gray, and white. Upon opening their eyes, they perceived the room as lifeless, with objects disintegrating in their vision. The center of their visual field retained some color while the rest became pixelated.

The participant described death as a stagnation of perception where reality gradually loses information until it dissolves entirely. They mourned the loss of experiencing anything again and feared eternal observation of this process. A thought about Jesus brought life back to their vision, leading to what they perceived as a resurrection. This experience led them to conclude that God is the power energizing reality through attention."
154,116350,"The participant began their journey in a comfortable home setting during evening hours. They experienced a rapid onset of effects after inhaling the substance, leading to visual distortions and eventually collapsing onto a sofa. In this altered state, they found themselves in an Arabian room with light blue colors. Initially, the ego was present, but it soon transformed into a more collective consciousness where thoughts and intuitions were transmuted into colorful ""assembly lines"" that flowed into a complex machinery at the center of the room.

The participant perceived other beings as alien entities with exploratory energy focused on understanding and collective growth. These entities communicated through simultaneous and creative dialogue, creating something in reality. The atmosphere was dreamlike with high energetic vibrations and stunning chromatic contrasts between celestial blue and pure sparkling lines of colors.

At one point, the participant felt a presence very close to their left ear, as if someone were breathing on them. There was no temporal dimension; everything existed in pure present. An intense energy discharge occurred as the participant shared deep energy with these entities. The experience concluded quickly but softly, leaving the participant feeling an inner energetic release."
155,116335,"The individual began their experience by ingesting an unknown substance accompanied by champagne at 2:00 PM in a backyard setting with friends. Around 30 minutes later, they noticed slight tingling sensations and visual changes such as pattern recognition and color enhancement. The participant felt comfortable and continued socializing while experiencing mild body load.

At the one-hour mark, additional doses were taken, including an oral dose of the initial substance followed by cocaine insufflation. This increased the intensity of the visuals and body warmth. The individual noted that the visual effects were more pronounced than with similar substances they had tried before. They also experienced a controllable headspace, allowing for clear communication despite the altered state.

Around 4:30 PM, as the sun began to set, the participant smoked weed alone in the backyard, enhancing the visuals without significantly disrupting their lucidity. Shortly after, they used DMT twice over about five minutes, experiencing heightened visual clarity and a sense of being present while observing intricate cosmic landscapes for approximately 15 minutes.

Throughout the experience, the individual interacted with friends and pets, maintaining social engagement despite the strong effects of the substances."
156,115943,"The participant experienced visual hallucinations that began with four nuns transforming into geometric patterns resembling Greek keys. These shapes were held above them in a cathedral-like setting and had a jester-like presence, causing discomfort and laughter. The participant then saw an open clam shell representing an emotional complex they wished to remove. A monk appeared, sneering and winking, as the clam began to close, revealing a phalloid structure and introducing themes of sexuality.

A mantis-like figure with feminine characteristics emerged, pushing on the participant's head while emitting high-frequency noise. This led to what was described as the 'BIZARRE BAZAAR,' an Arabian landscape filled with mystics such as wizards, priests, and shepherds. The environment had a male presence but was peaceful and spiritual.

The participant then entered a meditative trance after hearing chanting from a line of monks. Upon awakening, they experienced a loud buzzing noise that felt like an electric shock. The final hallucination involved a tera-pede sitting on their face, rubbing its genital region against them, causing feelings of claustrophobia and suffocation.

Throughout the experience, themes of sexuality, religion, and transformation were prevalent, with various entities appearing in different settings such as cathedrals and Arabian landscapes."
157,115568,"The participant began their experience by inhaling three long tokes of thick vapor from ""The Machine."" They immediately lost grip on reality and found themselves in a dark, endless realm strapped to a chair. Around them stood three or four tall, slim humanoid entities made of pure black ceramic with no facial features but each had a gold band around their head containing an embedded red crystal.

One entity approached the participant holding a transparent jug filled with viscous black liquid. The entity forced the participant's head back and poured the liquid down their throat. As it trickled through, the participant felt every cell being penetrated and torn apart. This process was observed by the other entities who stood around in silence.

The experience continued as layers of the participant's being were peeled away and examined by the entities. These layers represented experiences, memories, and emotions. The process eventually reached pure joy, good intentions, love, and beauty, overwhelming the participant with gratitude towards the entities for this experience.

The participant concluded that these beings are responsible for dissolving souls after death into a liquid concentrate to be judged by higher entities. After the dissolution was complete, the participant returned to their living room feeling speechless but eager to document the experience."
158,97325,"The participant was in a room with wooden walls containing dark knots. They smoked a large dose of a substance from a glass pipe, experiencing immediate onset of effects. Their pupils dilated significantly and they fell back onto the couch due to intense body load discomfort. 

Closing their eyes, they saw themselves zoom out into an outer space view of Earth connected by a DNA-like strand to a white alien world. They ascended this strand, leaving behind moving body parts like eyes and mouths which multiplied along it. Upon reaching the white world, all bodily sensation ceased.

In this perfect, colorful world, the participant encountered a loving consciousness resembling a mermaid but with undefined features. The experience felt timeless as they existed in harmony with this beautiful realm. However, when the music changed to become more intense, humans appeared and began destroying the perfect world, causing the participant to cry.

Returning to reality, the participant had tears on their face and felt as if weeks had passed despite it being a short trip."
159,105010,"The participant smoked a bong containing cannabis and DMT. After the first hit, they felt heavy in the chest area and saw psychedelic patterns on the ceiling and walls. The second hit intensified these effects, causing stronger physical sensations and vivid visual hallucinations. They perceived themselves traveling through colorful, patterned environments with constant motion.

The participant became disoriented and panicked, feeling trapped in an infinite loop of events happening simultaneously. They believed their friend was not real and slapped them, then stood alone contemplating the situation. After turning off the lights and returning to their friend, they calmed down when told that what they were experiencing was normal and would pass within an hour.

The participant turned on the TV for confirmation of reality and saw news and advertisements. They remained in a maniacal state of mind for about an hour after the peak effects subsided but eventually regained composure."
160,100707,"The participant began their experience after work, preparing with friends for a DMT session using ""The Machine."" They took roughly 200mg of Methylone earlier in the evening but did not feel significant effects. The participant then consumed approximately 50mg of DMT through ""The Machine,"" leading to vivid visual hallucinations including swirling patterns of colors and an encounter with a woman made of orange light. This entity provided philosophical insights, explaining that everything is interconnected and advising the participant to live in harmony with nature.

After this initial breakthrough, the participant experienced confusion about their identity and surroundings. They questioned J extensively about reality, communication, and their own existence. The participant's body movements were erratic as they tried to understand their physical form. J provided explanations and support throughout the experience, helping the participant regain a sense of normalcy after approximately one hour.

The participant later consumed another dose of DMT, this time around 200mg, leading to an intense state of confusion and questioning about reality. They repeated many questions multiple times, such as ""What is this?"" and ""Who are you?"" J continued to provide guidance and explanations until the participant began to recover after about one hour."
161,76849,"The participant began the experience lying down after smoking a substance. They felt their body start to disintegrate, with fingertips melting into balls that traced down their arms until both hands were gone, followed by their legs. The participant then found themselves outside of their physical form, observing the room fall apart until nothing remained except blackness and a basic awareness.

Feeling certain they were experiencing death, the participant was frightened but unable to perceive emotions or colors. After an unknown duration, they began to regain some sense of reality, seeing grays and blacks return. Upon sitting up, they reached for their friend's hand without being able to see their face clearly.

The friend reported that after smoking, the participant sat up with red eyes and a frightened expression, repeatedly asking ""where am I?!"" The friend attempted to calm them by explaining where they were and who they were. After the experience concluded, the participant had difficulty distinguishing reality and felt as if everything was new again, similar to a newborn's perspective."
162,70656,"The participant arrived at a house to try an unknown substance along with two friends who had previously used it. After observing the first friend's experience, the participant took two hits of the substance through a pipe. Immediately after inhaling, they experienced a tingling sensation that spread throughout their body and intensified rapidly. The room appeared to have a wavy tinge as if viewed through water.

The participant felt an overwhelming static-like feeling accompanied by complex visuals of swirling colors including whites, blues, browns, and reds. They reported discomfort in the throat and a desire for water. After drinking water, they lay back and let go, experiencing an intense but changing feeling that was similar to MDMA in its overwhelming nature.

The participant stared at the white ceiling, noticing colors from the walls melting into it. They felt as though they were seeing through their eyelids and remained aware of taking a drug while others observed them. About two minutes after inhaling, they sat up and smiled uncontrollably before laughing. For ten more minutes, everything had a different hue with a slight pull to it.

The participant stretched out again and experienced another wave of euphoria despite feeling slightly worn out. Throughout the experience, there was a mild discomfort but also an eagerness to try the substance again after the trip ended."
163,73844,"The participant smoked a large amount of substance and experienced a transformation of their room into a brightly colored, geometrically patterned environment. Sounds were altered, skipping, reversing, and having a massive echo delay. The user attempted to find familiar objects like the door but found them changed or missing. Beings appeared as balls of energy that moved with an echoing, reversing sound effect. The experience lasted for about 5-7 minutes before slowly returning to normal."
164,102649,"In a lit bedroom setting, the individual sat sedentarily on the floor facing a television screen playing pornographic content. After inhaling DMT from a glass pipe, they began to experience visual and sensory distortions. The room took on a dark pinkish tint, and the participant felt their body tingle with pleasure.

The focus shifted to the TV screen where the performers transformed into sentient beings. The female performer made eye contact and smirked, feeding off the participant's shock and awe. Her male co-star appeared as an enraged beast with a reddish glow surrounding him, performing in a dramatic and intense manner that seemed natural despite its intensity.

The woman's body changed to have a transparent blue force field-like appearance, which was ethereal and beautiful. The act continued for several minutes before the performers abruptly returned to being automatons. The participant felt deep emotions during this experience, including love and sadness when the female performer disappeared.

As the effects wore off, colors appeared ordinary with flickering waves visible through space. Upon rewinding the scene, it was mundane compared to what had been experienced on DMT."
165,97840,"The participant took an unknown dose of a substance and began experiencing effects almost immediately after inhaling it three times. They reported feeling a strong sense of familiarity, as if they were re-experiencing past lives or a previous existence. Visual distortions occurred both open-eyed and closed-eyed, with everything appearing in crystalline form featuring sacred geometry and fractals.

The participant felt their consciousness expand to encompass the entire 3D universe, becoming one with it rather than simply feeling connected to it. They communicated telepathically with entities who tried to teach them about letting go of fear but were unable to fully grasp these teachings due to the overwhelming nature of the experience. A specific visual that stood out was a green background with a white elliptical sphere containing various colored particles.

The participant's dog approached and interacted with them, though the sensation of touch felt different due to their altered state. After about 10 minutes, they began to return to their physical body but fought against it initially before finally opening their eyes. The environment remained visually distorted for another 10 minutes as the effects wore off.

The participant reported several key insights and changes in behavior following this experience, including a newfound appreciation for life without drugs and a decision to quit smoking cigarettes."
166,104982,"The participant experienced a powerful visionary state after inhaling DMT vapor. Within seconds of inhalation, visual distortions began, leading to an immediate transition into a profound, multi-plane fractal existence. During this period, they reported intense kaleidoscopic visions and a sense of ego dissolution. The experience included emotional and perceptual elements that seemed to blend together.

The participant noted the presence of two distinct strands of feeling-thoughts: one related to their school (School X) and another concerning the use of amphetamine earlier in the day. These thoughts were not linguistic but rather represented as feelings or sensations. Additionally, an unfamiliar taste in the throat contributed to a sense of unsettling novelty.

As the experience progressed, the participant became increasingly unsure about their own existence, questioning whether they were alive or dead. They also wondered if they might be having a heart attack or experiencing endogenous DMT release due to dying. The boundaries between objects in the room appeared to overlap significantly, causing discomfort as the participant tried to comprehend them.

Gradually, aspects of the physical environment became more coherent, and the participant began to interact with friends again. They expressed gratitude for their presence and repeatedly emphasized the profound nature of the experience. Upon coming down from the trip, they felt relieved that they were not dying and continued to reflect on what had happened.

The account also mentions that the use of amphetamine earlier in the day may have influenced the psychological aspects of the experience but did not definitively affect the visionary state or its intensity."
167,56557,"The participant prepared a substance following detailed instructions involving multiple steps including blending, boiling, filtering, and separating using chemicals such as muric acid, lye, and naphtha. After the preparation was completed, the individual inhaled the substance. The experience began with an intense rush feeling similar to after a long run, accompanied by visual distortions where everything appeared with green and red overtone colors. This lasted for about 30 seconds.

The participant then experienced brief periods of intense terror and paranoia, during which they curled up on the couch covered in a blanket. They observed visual effects such as oil or gas on water flowing over the ceiling for another 30 seconds. The experience was followed by standing up and running around in a paranoid state before returning to normalcy within about 5 minutes."
168,78273,"The participant consumed a substance mixed with marijuana in a natural setting during daylight hours. They experienced vivid visual hallucinations that began with dark visuals and gradually transitioned to bright light figures. These entities were translucent and became more visible over time, some appearing helpful while others seemed excited. The entities communicated through gestures but did not speak. A beautiful melody was heard throughout the experience. As the effects wore off, the participant felt a sense of rebirth and oneness with everything."
169,83189,"The participant began by taking what they believed to be a small dose of an unknown psychedelic substance through a bong mixed with cannabis. Initially, they saw vivid gold/yellow diamond shapes before experiencing a tunnel-like sensation filled with energy and light. They then opened their eyes to see the room as a colorful landscape composed of blocks of primary colors.

Lying back down, the participant felt detached from their body and was whisked away to another dimension where they communicated with three non-human entities. One entity appeared completely red, resembling a character from Star Wars. The beings provided information about reality that the participant found overwhelmingly amazing and laughed in response.

The experience included merging sounds with visual forms, as though sound and light were one. As the effects wore off, the room appeared to have an extra dimension, and the participant's friend seemed surrounded by a transparent shell. Shaking occurred as consciousness returned to their body, accompanied by a sense of losing vast amounts of information.

The following day, the participant felt a connection between themselves, animals, and the place they had been during the experience, suggesting a shared origin and future destination beyond this life."
170,70970,"The participant began their experience by taking multiple hits of an unknown substance after returning from a rave. They immediately experienced intense visual patterns that transformed into geometric shapes with vibrant colors. These shapes then formed into beings resembling humans but distinct, who engaged in dancing with the participant. The beings symbolized connectedness as they merged bodies while dancing.

The scene shifted to what appeared like a club, where the participant felt a sense of beauty and longing for the experience again. Inside, some beings mocked the participant's sadness by making faces and sticking out their tongues. 

Next, the participant found themselves in a rave setting dressed as a hoodlum, feeling regretful about indulging in drugs. This scene suggested a need to change one’s lifestyle.

The visuals then transformed into artwork that multiplied and formed stairs leading to a hallway. As the participant walked up the stairs, they felt accompanied by beings who validated Terrence McKenna's teachings through his voice playing from speakers in the hallway. The experience concluded with a fading sensation as the participant opened their eyes, feeling enlightened about various aspects of life."
171,107046,"The participant had two DMT sessions in their home, accompanied by friends. In the first session, they experienced visual effects including swirling colors and ribbons of light. They perceived a city park transforming into a miniature world inside a flower bulb, with hands holding up the earth. The walls of this room were described as veiny and resembling petals.

In the second session, an entity appeared that communicated about letting go. After this interaction, the participant saw their body as a pale-skinned ape with dark blue hair, floating in a fetal position. They experienced seeing all sides of things simultaneously and interacting with energy balls representing past experiences. The participant's movements during this experience included strange hand gestures and whispers."
172,113490,"The participant smoked an unknown substance and immediately entered a state of complete void, forgetting everything including their identity, the concept of time, and any physical sensations. The only thing they could hold onto was the name ""Bill."" After what felt like eternity, fear and anxiety emerged as the first physical feelings. They then slowly regained consciousness, opening their eyes to see another person (T). Upon seeing T, they expressed happiness but were still confused about words and concepts such as ""favorite."" The participant continued to feel disconnected from reality, repeating phrases like ""It's ok, I'm fine"" while hugging blankets for comfort. They questioned if the experience was akin to dying and cried intermittently between moments of joy upon realizing their return. Visual distortions included a moving TV screen and blue/purple lines resembling a flower. The concept of time gradually returned as they realized they would eventually come out of the void state."
173,99807,"The participant experienced an intense psychedelic episode after consuming 15mg of a substance while already under the influence of another psychoactive drug. The room transformed into an environment with an ""aztec"" and ""lego-land"" aesthetic. During this experience, the participant's dog (R), who had been asleep for several hours, suddenly woke up and began barking at thin air in multiple directions. R appeared to be trembling and spinning in circles while barking maniacally. The participant noticed that R's gaze was directed towards something unseen by them. After attempting to calm R down, the participant felt a sense of telepathic communication with the dog, who seemed angry and scared due to the experience. Once the substance wore off after about 10 minutes, R fell back into a deep sleep."
174,80764,"The participant began their journey after some preparation and a period of relaxation following dinner. They found themselves in a vast, luminous space filled with swirling colors and patterns that initially caused giggles but later evoked awe. The experience was described as seamless, without clear boundaries between different scenes or moments.

In this expansive environment, the participant encountered beings they referred to as ""machine elves."" These entities were depicted as spinning vortices of light and energy, seemingly engaged in some form of manipulation or demonstration involving light or energy. The interaction with these beings appeared educational, though not urgent, suggesting a patient and methodical approach.

As the experience came to an end, the participant heard what they described as ""Elven grammar,"" which evoked feelings of gratitude for having witnessed such an encounter. They expressed hope to continue exploring this realm in future sessions."
175,93875,"The individual describes two experiences with a psychoactive substance. In the first session, they smoked a small amount and felt mild visual effects such as swirling patterns on their hands. They returned to normal reality after a short period with slight euphoria.

In the second session, aiming for a more intense experience, they inhaled the vapor deeply and held it in. As soon as they exhaled, they noticed vivid hallucinations where everything seemed to vibrate and pulse with fractal rainbow light energy. The participant felt heavy and overwhelmed, experiencing a sensation of dissolving or fading out.

Objects around them began to disappear and reappear, pulsating with the same fractal light. They perceived these objects as part of their own mind and reality, feeling as though they were erasing files in a computer system. This led to fear but also an understanding that it was temporary due to the substance's effects.

The participant saw flashes of people from their life, no longer separate entities, which added to the frightening yet profound experience. They slowly returned to normal reality after a few minutes of ego dissolution and looked at a voice recording they had made during the trip, though not much was said."
176,106379,"The individual began their experience in a relaxed state at home. They smoked a substance three times before closing their eyes and taking a fourth hit. Upon closing their eyes again, they noticed intricate visual patterns resembling chrysanthemums made up of folding, hyper-spatial worms or snakes. The visuals intensified rapidly.

Suddenly, the participant found themselves in a space filled with blinding white light that folded and bent. They were surrounded by thousands of entities, though only one female entity was consistently present. These beings performed various actions on the individual, such as tearing them apart, reassembling them differently, and manipulating their consciousness. The environment felt surgical, and the participant experienced a sense of being operated upon.

After a few minutes, the white light began to dim, revealing an unusual creature that resembled a cross between a Jack Russell terrier, hamster, guinea pig, and Totoro from a Japanese cartoon. This creature engaged in a tug-of-war with one of the entities over some kind of tool. The participant then saw a futuristic tube filled with pulsing light and intricate geometric patterns before returning to reality.

Upon opening their eyes, they experienced intense aftereffects but felt back in control. They ran downstairs to share their experience with their housemate, expressing amazement at what had occurred."
177,114748,"The individual began the trip by vaporizing the substance and noted a taste and a shift in perspective. After two hits, they experienced visual distortions where objects appeared wavy. CEVs were digital with fine lines forming shapes on a white background. Visuals included bright colors moving constantly, reminiscent of stained glass windows. There was also a constant light source in the bottom left of their vision.

The participant felt relaxed and had no thoughts of danger during the visuals. They experienced physical sensations of cells vibrating and a warm feeling throughout their body. CEVs included characters such as a spider-like shape and a silhouette resembling a Disney witch with cartoonish white eyes.

Towards the end, the visuals changed to a white background with orange and blue meshes forming shapes. The participant felt physically stoned, with heavy but comfortable hands on their chest. The experience lasted approximately 8 minutes for the visuals, followed by a 5-minute comedown and afterglow."
178,114612,"The individual started their experience in a neutral headspace and used a brass screen method for intake. After about ten seconds, reality began to morph intensely. They dissolved into complex geometric visions and then into an embryo-like state with no abstract thought, only heartbeat sounds. This was followed by a hive-mind consciousness vision where the ego attempted to regain control, causing fear but leading to another oneness experience.

The participant then flew through colorful fractals in a tunnel until reaching a divine being at the core of this dimension. They experienced absolute unity with the universe and euphoria before returning partially to reality while still able to traverse the DMT realm. In this state, they spoke about everything being god and life. The ego continued to phase in and out, allowing them to relive oneness with multiple divine beings.

Near the end of the experience, they perceived infinitely many small entities embracing them unconditionally. After a further seven minutes, they were mostly back in reality but still felt afterglow geometry and a similar headspace. They recorded their experience for five more minutes before fully returning to reality within an hour, feeling only cannabis effects."
179,104016,"The participant prepared for the experience by organizing their backyard and gathering small magical objects. They sat on a beach blanket covered in comets and shooting stars, sipping water while contemplating the journey ahead. After some hesitation, they lit a bong filled with DMT and took several hits. Upon inhaling deeply, they experienced a shift in consciousness characterized by ringing in the head and visual distortions.

The participant reported seeing an alternate dimension fall from the sky onto them, accompanied by a face that was not clearly visible but present. A woman's voice soothed them, advising to ""look"" and ""watch."" The ego briefly attempted to assert itself, but the participant eventually let go of it.

In this altered state, the participant felt as though they were no longer in a body or human, existing instead as an experience within infinite fractals. They heard voices from entities telling them to look around. Time seemed non-existent and the experience was described as eternal despite lasting only minutes by human standards.

The participant wondered if they had died and were visiting death realms, noting vast spiritual beings moving past them too quickly to follow. A female voice reassured them that nothing could stop them and that failure or death did not matter since they would return here. The ego and spirit slowly reconnected with the body as the experience began to fade.

Upon returning to normal consciousness, the participant stretched gently before going inside where their girlfriend greeted them while preparing dinner. They discussed the trip briefly but found it challenging to convey the full experience without seeming strange or crazy."
180,114501,"The participant began by smoking a substance in a dimly lit room with friends present. After inhaling the smoke, they experienced a sense of heaviness and lay down to relax. They observed intricate psychedelic patterns that constantly changed shape and color.

A figure appeared, described as having a head, arms, and legs. The figure wore a gas mask and headphones, resembling something from the movie Predator. This entity moved its arm in sync with the background shapes, creating a dance-like motion. It gestured for the participant to look to the right while moving backwards.

The participant then found themselves floating without a body and noticed a book turning pages on its own. They hovered over the book and entered a city depicted on one of the pages. The city was golden with high-rise buildings, resembling Manhattan or another urban area. The inhabitants had bodies similar to souls from the movie Cocoon. Upon entering the city, many beings acknowledged the participant's presence but continued their activities.

The participant felt emotional about this experience and decided to return to physical reality by opening their eyes. They observed that the patterns in the room merged with those from hyperspace when they closed their eyes again. The visuals were clearer with closed eyes compared to open ones. After sharing their experience with friends, the participant reflected on it for years afterward."
181,114504,"The participant began with a small dose and gradually increased it over time. During this process, they experienced significant effects including visual and auditory hallucinations. Inanimate objects appeared to be alive and moving in a lifelike manner. The participant interacted with entities that took the form of various shapes and objects, such as a blanket with a face. These entities communicated complex messages through geometric patterns and shapes.

The deepest point came after consuming around 70mg, where the participant felt they were creating the universe and experienced profound thoughts about existence and creation. They reported feeling like God or Jesus but also realized that none of it mattered in the grand scheme of things. The experience was described as beautiful and meaningful despite its lack of inherent significance.

The participant manipulated their surroundings by lifting arms to create shapes and tilting the room, though they couldn't recall if any changes were permanent. They felt no fear or agitation throughout the experience, attributing this to their method of starting with a small dose and gradually increasing it."
182,106061,"The narrator prepared for the experience by meditating and setting up the room with incense and music. They smoked a substance infused into herb and immediately felt intense colors and sensations. After inhaling multiple hits, they lay down and closed their eyes. 

They saw a pink circle resembling those in ""Enter the Void,"" then swam in a purple and pink fluid where various entities appeared. Two black centipede silhouettes were present, along with other positive presences. The narrator felt overwhelming beauty and appreciation.

A giant Buddha statue floated by, followed by Ganesh's face which made an encouraging expression before entering the narrator's body, causing intense pleasure sensations. As visuals faded, the narrator felt residual sensations like insects swimming through their body and Ganesh remaining inside them.

The friend reported seeing a purple stream rising from the narrator's mouth and swirling energy above their head with insects present. They saw different insects than the narrator but both experienced blurring of consciousness boundaries during the trip.

Afterwards, the narrator felt positive about the experience and desired to meditate more often, appreciating this world and the other realm visited."
183,99429,"The participant experienced an intense trip characterized by the appearance of numerous fractal-like beings with simple faces that were laughing at them. One particular worm-like being paid close attention and interacted with the participant, cackling when the participant burped and pointing out their human limitations. The participant felt a tortuous perspective on existence, understanding that they existed as a human but could also exist in other realms. This realization was accompanied by a sense of being boxed in and limited as a physical being. Throughout the trip, the worm-like entity would laugh and remind the participant of their human form whenever there was any mental slip-up. The experience was described as both positive and torturous, providing insights into the nature of existence."
184,105536,"The participant prepared an extract from Acacia Confusa using a technique involving Pickling Lime and Naphtha. They consumed approximately 50mg of the resulting freebase through smoking. Shortly after inhalation, they experienced physical sensations such as tightening in facial and chest muscles, followed by a feeling of being pulled out of their body.

In this altered state, the participant traveled rapidly through time and space, encountering a vast wall that posed a question: ""IF YOU WISH TO GO FURTHER THEN, WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?"" Responding with ""Question,"" they were propelled through the wall into an interdimensional chamber. After emerging from this chamber, they found themselves in a surreal landscape characterized by a crimson sky and fluorescent trees reaching hundreds of feet high.

While exploring this environment, the participant sensed another presence nearby. Upon glimpsing this entity, which had an incomprehensible appearance, they were abruptly returned to their physical body. The encounter with the entity left them feeling unworthy and humbled."
185,105099,"The first experience began with the user feeling calm and relaxed after inhaling the substance. They then entered a state where they saw geometric patterns and colors while traveling through a tunnel. Upon reaching a small room, three dark figures appeared before them, swaying side to side in what seemed like a hypnotic dance. These beings had dreadlocks and extended their hands as if pushing the user away. The experience concluded with the sensation of passing through an invisible curtain back into reality.

In the second experience, the user felt submerged underwater initially but quickly transitioned to seeing everything around them digitize with bright colors. A beautiful woman then appeared above them, touching their face comfortingly. During this encounter, the participant expressed happiness and a sense of security verbally. The feeling of contentment persisted even after returning to reality."
186,114381,"The participant inhaled vapor through a pipe and laid back while holding their breath for as long as possible to absorb the substance fully. Within 30-60 seconds of inhaling, they began experiencing intense sensations, feeling lighter and having mild internal visual hallucinations. The experience was highly sensitive to sounds around them.

An intelligent airy voice emerged, repeating ""Who cares what other people are doing?"" for about half a minute. This repetitive phrase seemed to address the participant's social anxiety and emotional imbalance. The participant lost track of time during this introspective moment.

After the peak, they slowly regained physical composure but felt disoriented. They noted that despite the low dosage, it was an intense experience. The participant reflected on their recent struggles with addiction, loss, and health issues, which influenced their perception of the experience.

The account mentions being around someone struggling with alcoholism and the draining effect this has on them energetically. The participant is considering how to set healthy boundaries in this situation."
187,114258,"The participant experienced two doses of an unknown substance. During the first dose, they felt a change in perception accompanied by mild fractal closed-eye visuals. The second dose was more intense, described as similar to LSD but stronger, with vivid fractals and pleasant body sensations. They reported seeing waves breaking on the ceiling from light reflections and an ominous eye-like shape formed by shadows.

The participant then experienced a rapid onset of effects after inhaling a full bong hit. They felt nervous energy and heard an ascending whistling tone. Their body seemed distant, and closing their eyes led to a warp tunnel effect. The participant engaged in what they perceived as a two-way conversation with their body before entering a state of letting go.

In this state, the participant saw giant halls filled with transforming fractal crystals, cylindrical rivers containing moments in time, and fountains that turned into flowers of light. They encountered a peacock made of fractal crystal material with rainbow tail feathers and witnessed multiple rainbows within these visions. The experience was described as deeply beautiful and filled with sensations of love.

As the trip progressed, colors shifted to black and blue, indicating a fading effect. Towards the end, the participant perceived a female presence they referred to as Maya or their Goddess. This entity had seductive eyes and hair, and her smile was described as warm and beautiful. The experience concluded with a sense of loss as the participant returned from the heightened reality."
188,84936,"The participant begins by consuming the substance and immediately experiences visual distortions such as color changes, depth perception alterations, and swaying visuals. After closing their eyes, they see walls made of constantly changing hexagonal patterns predominantly in purple colors. They then encounter a hallway filled with green fractal shapes that explode into hexagonal patterns when pushed away mentally.

A presence is felt guiding the participant through this experience, expressing joy at their company and leading them further down the tunnel-like hallway. The participant feels their body dissolve into intense vibrations of pure ecstasy and joy, experiencing what they believe to be ego-death as they feel increasingly connected to a universal energy chain.

The presence eventually stops and smiles before fading away, coinciding with the participant regaining a sense of their physical body. Upon returning to normal consciousness, the participant reflects on the experience, feeling enlightened and understanding a deeper interconnectedness between all beings in the universe."
189,99321,"The participant reported an intense visual experience where objects in the room began to lose their normal structure and form, appearing to move in complex, three-dimensional patterns. A sari hanging from the ceiling showed oscillating line and diamond patterns that detached and moved in ways suggesting a glimpse of idealized forms rather than individual examples.

After inhaling, it became difficult to judge distances, with objects like a Tabasco bottle pipe becoming lost in swirling masses of lights, colors, and geometric shapes. The participant felt as if they were simultaneously rising and falling out of the ordinary world. Music played during the experience seemed to loop and spiral towards and away from them, with sounds appearing to last longer than usual.

The visual field was filled with small, indeterminate objects that swarmed around in a more-than-three-dimensional space. There were also charactered presences described as temporary convergences of light objects, each conveying a message or mood without clear direction at the participant. A dark sun lit up this shifting landscape from just outside the right side of their perceptual field.

The participant could hear others speaking but felt separated by an intangible barrier and couldn't understand what was said. Time perception was warped, feeling compressed rather than stretched. Opening eyes briefly led to sensory overload with shapes, colors, and movements flooding the senses.

Overall, the experience was described as a mix of opposites: mathematically beautiful yet disordered, relaxing but intense, joyful and frustrating, pure yet chaotic. The trip lasted about 8 minutes, after which the participant returned quickly to a normal state of mind despite the intensity of the experience."
190,80969,"The participant began their experience in a small room lying in bed, feeling nervous but determined to break through. After inhaling the substance three times, they entered a state of intense visual and auditory hallucinations. They saw intricate patterns and colors dancing around them, including deep magentas, pinks, lime greens, yellow, and white. The participant felt overwhelmed by the speed and intensity of the experience.

An entity appeared on their leg, described as a fat gnome/toad-like creature that stared at them without harm. The room was filled with a holographic grid in bright light. The participant experienced themselves as transparent, emitting an absurd light/energy that they could control. They spoke in what felt like an alien dialect and communicated through visuals.

The sense of depth and eternity in the visual structures was described as mind-boggling, creating a cavern of infinite bliss and perfection. After some time, the participant called two close friends into the room while still tripping. The friends' faces appeared to have beautiful eyes running up and down them, and their energy was visible to the participant.

The experience lasted for an extended period, with the participant oscillating between fear and awe before deciding to come out of it."
191,103238,"The participant began their journey in a garage setting with a friend, using a bong to inhale the substance. They experienced a heavy feeling in their body that was difficult but not painful to move. Visual patterns emerged as dark gray backgrounds with soft, slowly moving shapes that formed into 3D fractal kaleidoscopic patterns. These patterns were geometric and changed colors, mainly blues, reds, and green-yellows.

The participant traveled through a paradoxical tunnel made of rotating walls with jerky movements. The tunnel was described as having no beginning or end, with the center point wherever they looked. They alternated between being aware of their body and the fluorescent light in the room, experiencing fractal images emerging from these points and traveling through them.

During this time, the participant's friend drummed on a bucket, which caused a repetitive pattern where they would become aware of either their body or the light, move through the origin of the fractal image, then see the tunnel for its true beauty before repeating. This process felt like experiencing different dimensions or universes, each smaller or larger than the last.

The coming down was gradual, with increasing time spent in the physical world between dimensional experiences. The participant described their memory as foggy and two-dimensional compared to the intense, three-dimensional experience they had undergone."
192,114122,"The individual began their experience at a skatepark where they encountered an old friend (J). After some time together, they moved to a golf course where all three participants consumed LSD. As the effects of the LSD set in, the participant felt anxious and turned to alcohol for relief but found it ineffective due to the potency of the LSD.

Later, J asked about DMT, which the participant had with them. The participant packed a large amount of DMT into a pipe and smoked it, leading to intense visual distortions. They saw pulsating white light that transformed into a spherical tunnel-like structure with multiple layers, resembling an oval-shaped space. Geometric patterns flowed through this space like snakes.

The participant lost consciousness while in a trance-like state, mumbling and moaning. Upon regaining awareness, they were confused about the passage of time and their surroundings. J asked how the DMT experience was, prompting the participant to burst into tears from overwhelming emotions of awe, serenity, and love for the universe.

The participant then hugged J tightly and expressed affection towards everyone present, including a friend who had been bothering them earlier in the night. They spent the rest of the evening discussing their profound experience with J and his acquaintance. The trip concluded late at night when they left the golf course, and the participant felt emotionally vulnerable, expressing loneliness to J."
193,91819,"The participant began their experience in a living room setting with two friends. After consuming the substance, they experienced vivid visual hallucinations when closing their eyes, including intricate patterns and designs covering what appeared to be a ""kitchen."" They then observed beings in an underground setting who approached them curiously before moving on.

Upon further consumption, the participant entered what resembled a library filled with shelves of books. Here, they encountered entities referred to as ""jokesters"" who played tricks on them by appearing and disappearing, often leading the participant to chase after their movements or feet. The jokesters communicated through laughter and playful interactions but did not engage in direct conversation.

The participant then experienced being transported through different doorways that seemed to represent gateways to other dimensions or universes. In one such doorway, they encountered beings again who appeared to be gathering information from the participant's mind. These beings were described as an alien race communicating through visual and sensory experiences rather than verbal language.

Throughout the experience, the participant reported a strong sense of astonishment and amazement at the encounters with these entities and the vividness of their hallucinations."
194,90357,"The participant began their experience feeling excited but nervous about trying DMT for the first time after recently using LSD. After inhaling a large dose through a pipe with marijuana, they immediately experienced vivid visual distortions of their friend's face and surroundings. They quickly laid down on a couch as intense visuals continued.

The participant lost sense of self and felt trapped in an eternity of fear before breaking through to see a short pudgy alien entity that performed backflips and transformed into objects mid-flip. The alien tried to communicate and teach the participant, showing them a pyramid sphinx among other things. Other smiling entities appeared, conveying feelings of euphoria and love.

As reality returned, the participant felt intense vibrations throughout their body but was not bothered by them. They emerged from the experience with tears on their face, describing it as both frightening and beautiful."
195,114078,"The individual inhaled from a pipe and felt strong effects almost immediately. They found the music playing through headphones initially very annoying and removed them. This action led to visual disturbances characterized by black rectangular shapes attacking from all directions, causing discomfort. However, as the person engaged with these visuals more positively, they transformed into beautiful colors and shapes. The room appeared intermittently alongside these distortions, creating a dual-universe effect where real objects flickered in and out of existence. There was an impression of unseen friendly entities present during this time. After about seven minutes, the experience concluded, and normal vision returned."
196,110124,"The individual began their experience by smoking a substance through a pipe while two friends assisted in lighting it. As they puffed, the surroundings became increasingly distorted and surreal, with people appearing cartoon-like and two-dimensional. The person experienced uncontrollable body twitching and an intense urge to surrender. A loud 'ripping' noise was heard as the world transformed.

In this new universe, three golden beings performed a ritual dance in front of the individual, who observed them without interaction. Additionally, there was a black masculine figure staring directly into their soul, causing concern but no verbal communication. The person then entered a state of free-flowing consciousness, observing their body from above before returning to it.

Upon re-entering normal reality, complex geometric patterns were seen fading away. The individual felt serene and pure, with an overwhelming sense of peace and contentment as if enveloped in love."
197,113883,"The participant had high expectations for their first psychedelic experience after researching online and listening to various speakers discuss similar journeys. They initially tested a small amount of the substance, feeling extremely anxious despite previous experiences with other psychedelics. Two days later, they decided to try again alone in a cozy setting, surrounded by stuffed animals and listening to music.

Upon inhaling the vaporized substance, their vision distorted, and they felt nervous but proceeded to lie down and close their eyes. They experienced an altered state where everything seemed like a soup without clear boundaries between objects or self. The participant perceived themselves as part of this fluid environment, moving through it in a disorienting manner similar to chasing oneself through doors in a Scooby Doo episode.

During the experience, they communicated with their stuffed animals and felt a sense of unity with them. There was a moment when the music seemed frozen, followed by a vivid taste that reinforced the soup-like quality of the trip. As things began to return to normal, the participant quickly got out of bed in an attempt to feel more grounded.

The experience left the participant uncertain about trying the substance again but open to the possibility that they might reconsider after some time had passed."
198,113689,"The individual experienced visual distortions including fractal patterns and swirling nightscapes after inhaling the substance. They saw an eye-like light in the mountains and northern lights-like visuals when closing their eyes. A presence was felt, described as a collection of knowledge rather than emotions, which communicated through imagery such as recreated aztec murals. The presence spoke of a hotel stay and seemed to want to exchange experiences with the individual. Auditory changes included an echoing bark from a dog. Blinking produced 4D evercreating building visuals. The experience led to philosophical reflections on life's purpose and control."
199,101234,"The participant smoked 70mg of a substance and experienced being transported into another dimension with different physical laws. They encountered an entity described as a female fairy-like figure wearing a red, shiny space suit and holding a wand that emitted bursts of color. The entity created a transparent, three-dimensional rectangular object with rainbow edges using her wand. Initially panicked, the participant tried to avoid the entity's attention but was unable to do so. A message from an earlier experience helped calm them down before returning to their body."
200,110770,"The participant began with 20 minutes of loving-kindness meditation before inhaling a vaporized substance through a glass pipe. During this initial experience, they felt fine, blissful vibrations throughout their body, accompanied by complex, dynamic geometric patterns in shades of blue and purple. The visual patterns were followed by an oscillating white light indicating the end of the state.

After the first session, the participant engaged in one hour of meditation with notable afterglow effects. They experienced full-body breathing sensations that were blissful but coarser than those during the initial experience. The bodily bliss present in the first jhana was similar to the DMT trip but more coarse and less precise.

In a second session, the participant inhaled another dose of the substance. This time, they saw complex geometric patterns with hues of gold and yellow, along with an element of white light shining over them from a dynamic locus. The bodily bliss was more internal and less vibratory compared to the first experience.

Abstract female entities began to appear from the geometries, dancing in phase with the patterns. The participant felt an intense emotional yearning for motherly embrace and encouragement, which took the form of misty, complex tendrils visible around them. These tendrils seemed to represent both physical sensations and their emotional state.

As the intensity of the emotional yearning increased, the female entities merged into one abstract but beautiful entity that embraced the participant in a motherly role. The entity provided non-verbal assurance that everything was okay and there was no need to suffer. This emotional bliss emanated from the participant's chest. As the experience began to fade, the entity stayed with them briefly before leaving."
201,110333,"The participant consumed a dose of the substance and experienced an extremely difficult journey that felt like an eternity. They reported feeling separated from their usual reality by a colorful veil and encountered both the Abyss and Void. There were no elves or bouncing toys as in previous experiences; instead, they found themselves in unfamiliar dimensions with impossible geometry and psychedelic colors.

Upon opening their eyes, everything appeared distorted, resembling 32-bit Lego structures, which was described as scary. Closing their eyes again led to ego death, where the participant's body dissolved into the universe before returning to it. They also experienced a small room with dim lighting, stuffed animals or dolls, and rose decor in an arch-shaped wall.

The substance laughed at them during the experience, telling them they got what they asked for as a remedy to their anxiety and OCD. The participant questioned many aspects of life and reality, feeling that science held no meaning there. They communicated with a trip sitter through a tablet, asking if they were still in real life. Eventually, they returned to normalcy but felt transformed by the experience."
202,108843,"The individual prepared DMT by vaporizing it in a bong with brillo pads as a filter. They took three pulls, holding the last breath for as long as possible before lying down. Initially, they experienced visual tracers and patterns but then felt detached from their body, unable to determine if their eyes were open or closed. This led to fear of death, exacerbated by cartoonish yellow hands fumbling with their clothes. They passed out after about 15 minutes, waking up frustrated without achieving the desired 'breakthrough' experience."
203,107570,"The individual consumed an analog of Ayahuasca made from Peganum Harmala seeds and DMT crystals. After ingesting the substance, they experienced a gradual onset of effects starting around 9:32, characterized by slight stomach discomfort and increased heart rate. By 10:45 to 1:00 am, intense hallucinations began.

During this period, the participant reported seeing fractal patterns in everyday objects such as carpets and water, which appeared alive and communicated stories telepathically. The experience was described as overwhelming, with a constant flow of information that was difficult to process.

The individual also encountered several entities during their trip. One entity guided their friend through his experience, while another placed its hand on the participant's shoulder in a stern manner. These beings were not just visual but interacted physically and communicated telepathically.

Thought processes became highly associative, with ideas leading rapidly to others. The participant learned that focusing on choosing between two ideas could help manage this flow of thoughts. Cannabis was used by their friend to slow down the experience.

The effects lasted until around 2:15 am when the individual began coming down from the trip. By morning, they felt lighthearted and more sober but still had altered thought processes without hallucinations. The next day, these effects continued to normalize, though the participant couldn't stop thinking about their experience."
204,83784,"The participant inhaled a significant amount of a psychedelic substance through a glass pipe. Upon inhalation, they experienced an immediate and intense rush that left them feeling overwhelmed and questioning if they were dying or dead. They felt as though they were being sucked backwards into a foreign universe, flying above sharp, crystalline peaks with vague citrine coloring.

During the experience, the participant's environment became highly distorted, with everything fractalizing and refractalizing, pulsing with light. The music playing in the background was heard clearly but appeared visually blurred except for the word ""Shpongle"" on the computer screen. As the intensity began to drop, they slowly regained awareness of their breathing and surroundings.

The entire experience lasted approximately 7-8 minutes. Upon coming out of the trance state, the participant felt a sense of relief and gratitude for returning safely to reality."
205,113008,"The participant smoked a small amount of a psychoactive substance mixed with marijuana in their art studio. They felt immediate intense effects characterized by auditory sensations like standing behind a jet plane, chest pressure, and visual distortions where everything turned white and textured. The participant removed their glasses as they felt heavy on their face.

A female entity appeared next to the participant, placing hands on their arm and communicating telepathically that ""you never knew you were so heavy"" before disappearing. After this interaction, the participant lost consciousness for an unknown duration.

Upon regaining awareness, the surroundings seemed alive with energy, electrical conduits resembled snakes, and paintings shifted in appearance like projections from a wizard's realm. The participant felt compelled to express positive thoughts aloud to maintain a pleasant experience.

Gradually, the intensity of colors diminished, and the electrical sensations faded. The participant felt slightly off balance, possibly due to marijuana consumption, but experienced no negative aftereffects and considered it a positive encounter that might be repeated in the future."
206,103215,"The participant had an initial dose of a substance and gradually increased the dosage over about an hour. They experienced visuals that were immersive and unique compared to previous experiences with other hallucinogens. When eyes were closed, they observed morphing geometrics and shooting stars. With their eyes open, they saw pine trees outside their window undulating in an entrancing manner.

The effects of each dose lasted for a short period, typically around 2 minutes at peak intensity followed by about 5 minutes of less intense high. The participant found the experience to be brief and somewhat disappointing compared to expectations based on literature. They mentioned preferring shorter half-life hallucinogens but felt that this substance's duration was too short.

The participant noted heightened senses during the trip, including a decent body high. There were no hangover effects experienced after the session."
207,112908,"The participant began their experience by ingesting two tablets of a substance, leading to vivid visual effects including enhanced color perception, geometric patterns, and tracers. They then smoked approximately 25-30mg of another substance, experiencing immediate auditory and physical sensations. In the resulting hallucinations, they encountered an entity described as an ""Overlord"" with a pyramid-shaped head and a humanoid body made of geometry, sitting on a throne in a rainbow room filled with patterns and colors. The Overlord approached closely before launching the participant into hyperspace, where they saw rapidly changing dimensions. They then witnessed infinite snake-like figures arranged in a grid pattern similar to something from ""The Matrix."" As the experience progressed, visual effects diminished but remained profound."
208,112821,"The participant smoked a substance from their pipe while sitting in full-lotus position on the floor of their apartment at midnight. They felt close to breaking through but did not achieve it fully. Transient visual images appeared, including jester-like entities. The experience was primarily characterized by intense mental activity, with deep and profound mathematical concepts being shared wordlessly. Specific terms like ""Riemann Hypothesis"" were mentioned. This lasted approximately five minutes before the participant opened their eyes and returned to reality. They continued to feel the effects for some time afterward, lying in a fetal position on the floor and laughing at the explosion of thoughts they had experienced."
209,112706,"The participant experienced a vivid scenario where they perceived themselves as having died and attending their own funeral. They saw familiar faces but believed them to be there for the funeral, including their girlfriend and her brother. The setting included candles and a board with ""Think Positive"" written on it. The participant felt regret over unfulfilled wishes and was convinced that this was how things were meant to be due to feeling hot without a shirt. They did not see any entities but experienced terror and a malevolent presence, compelling them to give up on life. After about 15 minutes, the physical effects subsided, though the mental impact remained significant."
210,93693,"The participant began experiencing tingling sensations throughout their body shortly after inhaling the substance. They closed their eyes due to visual distortions in their environment. As the experience progressed, they saw geometric shapes primarily consisting of rectangles in varying shades of silver within an open space. This was followed by imagery of organs and internal anatomy depicted in warm red tones.

Throughout the trip, a loving entity was perceived, conveying unconditional acceptance and happiness. The participant felt reassured that this entity would be present even outside altered states of consciousness and invited to return at any time."
211,97454,"The participant experienced several intense drug-induced episodes characterized by vivid visuals and auditory phenomena. In the first episode, they flew through a pastel cloud-like world before entering a domed structure where two large entities, approximately 800 to 1000 feet tall with gem-like skin and stereotypical alien features, communicated that the participant was not supposed to be there yet. The second episode involved observing a village of huts and black, rubber-band ball-like objects floating around them in a void. In the third episode, tentacles wrapped around the person, and hieroglyphs appeared before their eyes, conveying information in an unknown language. The fourth episode was shared with another individual and featured an entity called ""Dog-Bear-God,"" which had a felt-like texture, minimal features, large dark eyes, and communicated that the encounter was too deep for the current time. The fifth episode included lower-dose trips with various visual distortions such as furniture moving and tapestries morphing into faces."
212,96825,"The participant smoked two hits of a substance, experiencing rapid onset effects within seconds after exhaling the second hit. They reported visual distortions such as patterns on objects, geometric shapes, and colors becoming alive. The room appeared to dissolve into black space with stars, leaving only the window visible. 

After a third hit, they felt their thoughts being destroyed and experienced a sense of timelessness. They observed themselves leave their body and watched scenes where friends ridiculed them for doing drugs and where police took their body away. This was followed by an experience of flying up from Earth into space, feeling pure bliss.

The participant then encountered a white pulsating door with colored lights and music, which they entered to find people flying around. They asked if this was real, receiving a response in a childlike manner that it wasn't the right question and that they would see each other again. This led to a rapid return to their body.

Upon re-emerging, walls were covered in patterns, and the song resumed from where it had stopped. The participant felt a new sense of peace but was disturbed by finding pages filled with writing that did not match their usual handwriting or grammar. They noted several passages about universal concepts such as love, time, and the nature of reality."
213,89940,"The participant felt an overwhelming rush that transported them to another place. Initially, they were powerless and experienced intense fear as their senses struggled to comprehend the unfamiliar situation. They briefly regained awareness but then felt stuck in time when a cat walked near them, repeating the same motions over and over. This led to a sense of being suspended between dimensions with no concept of time.

Seeking familiar surroundings, the participant moved to another room but found it difficult to locate anything recognizable, causing further unease. They eventually sought comfort from someone named Craig, who helped normalize their perception of time. Returning to the living room, they experienced enhanced sensory input and a fleeting feeling that everything was dead and lifeless before gradually returning to normalcy.

The entire experience lasted approximately ten minutes but felt much longer due to the altered perception of time."
214,101758,"The participant had several previous experiences with a substance and was familiar with its effects. On this occasion, they inhaled the substance at a higher dose than before. Initially, their vision became highly detailed and compressed into single points and lines. They felt an energy surge through their body as if traveling rapidly through space, gaining knowledge from various planets.

After reaching a state of stillness, the participant saw a 2D projection of a metallic room with gold fractals and red/purple diamonds. The scene split into two overlapping images that changed independently. The participant then noticed an iPod on a dock turning on and off and became aware of their surroundings again.

Upon looking at their arm, they perceived a physical aura or energy field around everything in the room, held together by visible strings at the atomic level. This phenomenon was observed on objects like the couch, TV, and other people present. The participant felt a sense of cosmic connectedness and thought about others who had experienced this state before.

The experience lasted approximately 15 minutes before returning to normal consciousness with no lingering effects."
215,98655,"The participant began the experience in their suburban backyard under moonlight. After inhaling a large dose of an unspecified substance, they immediately felt its effects, noticing the world take on a shiny, underwater appearance. Their dog barked rhythmically at the moon, which was unusual behavior for the animal. A clock face appeared in their vision, ticking to the dog's barks.

The participant then found themselves floating in space before a large grey cube warping spacetime. They experienced 4-D vision, seeing through multiple sets of eyes simultaneously. Teleported to a brighter area with yellow and green hues, they observed their body rotating like a gyroscope while binary code flashed across their vision. This part was interpreted as being downloaded into the astral realm.

Flying at high speed past binary sequences, the participant's perspective shifted between viewing their own body from various angles and seeing themselves as an electron orbiting an atom. They encountered a vast cube network of beeping, changing 2-D dots, one of which represented their own body part (asshole). The experience included synesthesia and morphing into energy and technology.

Upon returning to consciousness, the participant responded in an altered state, identifying themselves as both Zack and ""the entirety of the universe."" They remained motionless for a few minutes before sobering up. The afterglow lasted several days, characterized by brighter colors and feelings of relaxation, happiness, insightfulness, intuition, spirituality, and philosophical reflection."
216,62369,"The experience began immediately after inhalation, with room details becoming alive and fuzzy. As the intensity increased, the participant felt torn from reality with an intense tearing sensation that blended with visual imagery. The room disappeared, replaced by rapid movement of colors and lights, creating a sense of acceleration without gravity. Visuals were complex geometric objects in more than three dimensions, including circles turning through each other.

The participant did not encounter any specific entities but had the feeling of not being alone. There were detailed audio hallucinations described as warbling tones and odd sounds that were felt rather than heard. The experience included a drop back into reality for a brief moment before returning to intense visuals. After 10 minutes, movement ceased, leaving slight swimming effects similar to low-dose mushrooms.

The afterglow was characterized by awe, energy, and euphoria lasting up to an hour after the primary effects subsided."
217,97943,"The participant reported an intense out-of-body experience following multiple hits from a vaporizer. They saw vivid geometric patterns in bright colors against a dark background that had an infinite depth. In the center of this environment were two entities resembling sphinxes, which changed shape when viewed directly. These entities eventually merged into one towering form that frightened the participant. The music playing during the experience influenced the visual and emotional aspects; changing songs altered the scenery from fiery red and yellow hues to fading visuals. The participant experienced a sense of losing their physical body, feeling as if it was made of sand that withered away. The entire trip lasted approximately 27 minutes but felt much shorter."
218,81751,"The participant began their experience by vaporizing a small amount of crystals in a glass pipe with an added layer of herb. They felt immediate effects after a few tokes. The trip lasted approximately ten minutes, with about two minutes at peak intensity. During this time, they experienced a rapid flash of memories and intense anxiety, believing they were either dying or trapped in a chaotic mental state.

Visual hallucinations included a demon-like entity with butterfly wings that appeared to be laughing at them. This was followed by the perception of being in a laboratory setting where four individuals wearing lab coats seemed to be studying them. One person sat next to the participant and repeatedly urged them to ""wake up"" and join their world. The participant struggled to regain control over their emotions, which were characterized by overwhelming anxiety and fear.

As the experience progressed, reality returned gradually, with details reappearing in stages, similar to a rendering process. Upon returning to the real world, the participant felt humbled and grateful for having survived the intense experience."
219,90401,"The participant inhaled an unknown substance while sitting in their friend's living room. Within seconds, they felt a heavy sensation throughout their body except for their head. As they relaxed into the experience, their worries and stresses disappeared. They stared at a blank wall illuminated by soft light, which began to show vivid visual hallucinations.

Initially, these hallucinations depicted what appeared to be an intricate 3D movie of evolution, starting with a small drop that materialized and fell away from them. This evolved into a colorful explosion on the wall, showing complex evolutionary processes beyond human understanding. The participant felt profound insight during this phase.

Three minutes later, they inhaled again and saw alien-like faces, which at first frightened but then provided a sense of security. They also observed intricate geometric patterns covered with eyes. After the main intensity wore off, the participant tried to recall everything seen during the experience."
220,62590,"The participant experienced intense effects after inhaling a high dose. The room appeared animated with objects pulsing with life, including stereos vibrating in harmony and a palm tree dancing. An entity resembling someone not closely known to the participant was perceived but did not feel ominous. Closing eyes led to a multidimensional journey through colors and shapes described as ""infini-D."" This was followed by a moment of silence, white light, and black dots before returning to reality with disappointment."
221,87683,"The participant began their journey by consuming mushrooms and acid, along with smoking marijuana to enhance the experience. They reported feeling a presence throughout the trip but could not identify it until later when they saw an alien-like face on an aspen tree that mirrored their emotions through its expressions. The participant also experienced auditory hallucinations of humming sounds.

After some time, the friend S consumed DMT and had his own intense experience while the others waited quietly. Later, the participant decided to consume DMT themselves and encountered a tall grey entity who communicated non-verbally but conveyed gratitude for their relationships and advised them to appreciate what they have in life. The participant then traveled through fractals before returning to earth.

In another session of DMT consumption, the same entity returned and introduced the participant to Shiva, who showed them how to achieve happiness by studying Hinduism. The experience was described as extremely joyful and blissful."
222,79695,"The participant experienced an intense trip after smoking a substance mixed with marijuana. Within 15 seconds of inhalation, they felt a harsh odor and began hearing loud ringing in their ears. Visuals were described as vibrant colors and swirling shapes that could not be stabilized. Closing their eyes led to vivid closed-eye visuals resembling rapid dream sequences.

The experience intensified rapidly, leading to the perception of flashing imagery similar to near-death experiences, including visions of ambulance lights, death pronouncement, family members crying, and a friend committing suicide. The participant felt they were dead and spoke out loud in fear, believing they were speaking gibberish.

Upon regaining consciousness, everything appeared strange again, and the participant felt confused as if they had become ""retarded."" For several minutes after coming down, visual distortions persisted. They sat for five hours without using any other substances before returning to their campsite and giving away all remaining substance to others who enjoyed it."
223,89308,"The narrator and three friends consumed a substance multiple times throughout an evening. Each person had varying experiences, characterized by intense visual hallucinations of geometric patterns and feelings of euphoria. The first round involved 30mg doses for each participant, resulting in short but enjoyable trips with some disconnection from the physical world.

In subsequent rounds, dosages increased. One friend experienced a loss of connection to reality briefly, while another had extended laughing fits. During these sessions, the narrator reported full hallucinations and an internal conversation with an external force.

The final round took place at a different location with two additional friends joining in. Each person ingested 30mg doses again, experiencing similar intense visual hallucinations and general happiness. One friend laughed for 15 minutes after consuming 50mg, while another briefly lost connection to reality and made animal-like noises upon emerging from the trip.

The narrator's final experience involved a higher dose of 80mg mixed with marijuana. They reported losing consciousness quickly but having an unusual trip characterized by a lack of sensory perception (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell). Instead, they experienced constant emotional flow and were guided through their journey in a physical sense.

Upon coming out of the trips, participants felt confused and astonished by the intensity of the experiences."
224,112058,"The participant began by vaporizing a substance in a glass pipe, aiming for a high dose after previous experiences had not resulted in a full ""breakthrough."" Upon taking one large hit, they felt intense sensations and quickly lost connection with reality. Their visual field dissolved into incomprehensible patterns, prompting them to close their eyes.

During the experience, which lasted approximately 7-10 minutes, the participant encountered an entity described as malevolent and indescribable in nature. This encounter evoked feelings of dread and other negative emotions, likened to a state of Hell. The participant felt disconnected from reality, existing in a realm of abstract ideas where concepts like existence were incomprehensible.

Physical reactions included dry-heaving, likely the body's response to the substance. Time perception was distorted; what felt like hours or days could have been only minutes. Upon regaining some awareness towards the end of the trip, they perceived differently colored blobs representing furniture in their surroundings.

After the experience ended, the participant felt traumatized and struggled to process the event for about 20 minutes. They experienced lingering effects such as nightmares and flashbacks triggered by other substances like cannabis for several weeks afterward."
225,98928,"The individual began their experience by praying for protection and healing before inhaling a dose of the substance. They felt a strong force pulling them from their body as they entered a dark, fractal-filled space. After this initial phase, they were enveloped in a soft, net-like substance that led to an encounter with two Jungle Gods and a smaller entity. These beings appeared as giant figures made of smooth green ribbons surrounding a core of fire. The participant felt immense love and bliss while with them.

The experience then shifted to a temple where the individual encountered Buddha. Communication occurred through a non-verbal, telepathic-like method, during which the participant gained profound insights about consciousness evolution and their personal growth despite their illness. After this encounter, smaller gnome-like beings appeared, singing the participant back into a blissful state.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling gratitude, awe, and rapture, expressing thankfulness for the blessings received."
226,94883,"The participant began their experience by taking 3 tabs of LSD about 10 hours before the experiment. They then smoked a bowl containing both DMT and weed in a cow pasture. Initially, intense visual and auditory hallucinations made it difficult to concentrate on the task at hand. However, as these effects subsided, they were able to focus on sending empathetic messages of love and peace to the herd.

The herd responded by moving around the participant and grazing nearby, which filled them with euphoria. Five cows then surrounded the participant, staring intensely from a distance of no more than two feet away. Three of those cows approached even closer, rubbing their noses against the participant's feet before calmly walking away.

As the DMT began to wear off, the participant felt elated and returned to human areas. They noted that patience, tranquility, compassion, and love were key qualities in achieving this kind of telepathic communication with cows."
227,111947,"The individual inhaled a substance and experienced an intense rush followed by visual distortions and fractal patterns. They felt panic and disorientation, questioning the nature of their identity and existence. A mantis-like entity appeared, tearing open their chest and removing organs before reconstructing them with green, light-emitting objects. The experience concluded with a sense of rebirth and transformation, leaving the individual feeling enlightened about the nature of consciousness and life."
228,109799,"The participant began by smoking an unknown amount of substance from a vaporizer. They reported immediate effects, feeling warmth in the back of their head and visual distortions such as swirling geometric patterns. After several inhalations, they experienced intense sensations of falling through colorful shapes and forms that were indescribable even years later.

Upon reaching another realm, the participant encountered elves who sang and danced around them, expressing joy at their arrival. The elves communicated with the participant, answering questions about knowledge and showing scenes from the participant's life. This interaction led to a sense of omniscience as the elf taught the participant various concepts in simple terms.

The experience then shifted to exploring an endless array of galaxies, each more fascinating than the last. The participant felt a deep emotional connection with a powerful entity described as divine, leading to intense feelings of love and euphoria. This was followed by a loud gong-like sound that brought the participant back to reality after what they perceived as a long journey but turned out to be only 13 minutes."
229,80529,"The user begins to feel visual distortions immediately after inhaling the substance, noting a vibrating sensation that causes everything to look blurry. Patterns emerge on their body parts, particularly the arms and legs, forming intricate fractal designs that morph rapidly. They hear a buzzing sound throughout this period.

At around 15 minutes in, the visuals change, and the user finds themselves in an alien rainforest surrounded by entities described as ""machine elves."" These elves are depicted as lines of energy and have specific physical characteristics such as carrot-like hands and colorful bricks. The user hears strange chatter and unidentifiable noises from these entities.

The user interacts with one elf who appears important, causing them to calm down. They observe a rotating, glowing geometrical flora in this alien world before returning to their familiar environment after about 25 minutes.

After the experience, the user stands up and walks to friends, still experiencing strong visual effects such as enormous tracers filled with fractals. The user expresses relief at being ""home"" again but also mentions a slight euphoria from recalling glimpses of the alien world."
230,88931,"The participant began their experience by smoking a bong containing marijuana and DMT crystals. After several hits, they experienced increased heart rate and visual distortions such as vibrating objects and morphing surroundings. They felt detached from reality while also experiencing vivid sensations.

A buddha-like presence appeared in the room, emitting a comforting vibe and encouraging the participant to stop racing their mind and let go into the DMT trance. However, the participant's conscious mind resisted this, maintaining a sense of reality as a defense mechanism.

The participant then heard an enchanting song with lyrics that seemed to be directly addressing them: ""Let your mind go, just let it flow."" This led to intense laughter as they realized the drug was using music to coax them into trance. The visuals and sensations continued to be vivid but eventually subsided as the experience came to a close.

The entire trip lasted approximately 15 minutes, with the participant feeling great upon returning to normalcy."
231,89827,"The participant began their experience by ingesting a substance through four hits from a pipe. After several minutes, they took another hit while listening to music. They experienced vivid visual hallucinations characterized by bright colors and patterns, including gold streaks and shifting color schemes of light blue and spring green. 

A humanoid entity appeared before them, initially resembling a woman with feathers around her head, but then morphing into a genderless being described as supremely perfect and embodying all creation. The participant communicated with this entity, asking if they would return to this place again and whether astral projection could be used to reach it. The entity assured the participant that both were possible.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling an intense sense of relief and a lingering glow similar to after consuming another psychedelic substance."
232,84821,"The participant attended a gathering at a friend's house where they consumed a substance through smoking. They had previously tried this substance once before but found this experience to be more intense. The group prepared in a quiet room while listening to calming music. The participant took three hits of the substance, which caused immediate visual effects including bright orange and yellow squares that transformed into dancing flames and floral patterns.

The participant's perception of their friends' speech became distorted, sounding like gibberish. They experienced an accelerated heartbeat and felt panicky at times. There was a sense of ego loss where reality seemed to dissolve, but this wasn't particularly frightening for the participant who had experienced it before. Physical sensations included feeling refreshed by a fan blowing above them and experiencing sexual arousal.

As the effects began to wear off, the participant joined in conversations with their friends about their experiences. They felt cold and started shivering as they came down from the trip."
233,96827,"The participant smoked the substance in their room alone, listening to instrumental music. They felt euphoria but initially did not experience significant visuals or effects. On a subsequent attempt, they took larger hits and immediately noticed a loss of coordination and began experiencing visualizations with brightly colored rectangles expanding from an invisible center point.

Moments later, the visuals became brighter and whiter, with many shapes engulfing them. They saw what they believed to be an Asian lady who was beautiful and smiling at them. She would pull them closer then morph into a shape, specifically her hands which signalled them closer before transforming into another form. The participant felt as if she was teasing them but maintained a smile.

Amidst the visuals, large eyeballs appeared on what seemed like a screen, vanishing to be replaced by morphing shapes including one that resembled a middle finger. This made the participant laugh internally but they then began respecting these visuals more and focused on sounds described as sophisticated, organized tones similar to dubstep.

Voices from outside the room gradually brought them back to reality. The trip concluded with a faint colorful vibrating line containing a rectangular piece in the center. Upon opening their eyes after the experience, the participant saw a body lying there but felt that their mind had remained intact throughout the journey."
234,90713,"The participant consumed an unknown substance over several days in increasing doses. The first dose produced a body buzz and enhanced visual perception. Subsequent doses, doubling the amount each time, led to stronger visuals, nystagmus, euphoria, and a more energized feeling. By the fourth day, larger amounts were required for similar effects, but even then, the experience was uncomfortable. On the final attempt of the fourth day, after a break from using the substance, multiple doses did not produce any significant effect despite initial expectations. The participant also noted a reduced high when consuming another substance (bowl of bud) on the same day."
235,97495,"The individual experienced fractal patterns and an orange figure with a spiral face after inhaling the substance. They heard a voice say, ""it's inevitable."" Following this, they encountered chaotic colors that darkened progressively, causing intense emotional distress and physical discomfort described as being ripped apart atomically. The participant reported hearing another voice describe their current state as true sadness and hellish conditions. They saw skulls and demons during the experience. After returning to reality, the individual was concerned about re-entering the altered state."
236,111779,"The individual began by meditating before inhaling the substance. After two hits, they experienced intense visuals characterized by a grid-like digital spiderweb structure. Closing their eyes led them to a cartoonish mathematical place where parts of themselves disintegrated into this structure. The experience then transitioned to a large geometric face that made them laugh, followed by an expansive space with soft, dark grid patterns and ethereal, ever-changing pillars forming a central 'face'. This 'face' emitted warm, euphoric, and sexual sensations. As the effects wore off, they felt immense gratitude for their human experience upon returning to their body."
237,90354,"The participant inhaled smoke from a green bong, experiencing initial discomfort before entering an altered state. They saw electric blue geometric forms behind their eyelids and perceived their hands as enlarged with deep lines resembling canyons. The ivy on a fence appeared to move like a carpet of jungle green.

A holly tree was described as leering, its roots appearing squid-like and blackening away from the participant's touch. A voice echoed in the participant's head, telling them not to look at the holly tree because it didn't understand. The holly tree had a maw that opened like a Venus flytrap with resined teeth, and insect eyes glared at the participant.

An elm tree communicated positively through its movements and sounds, expressing happiness about the participant's presence. Its leaves changed colors and reattached themselves as young buds, indicating it still had some life left despite approaching winter.

The participant also saw Vishnu sitting on their chest before he disappeared into a spinning aquamarine mandala. The experience concluded with the participant in a blue canvas chair, feeling emotional about what they had seen and expressing appreciation to their lover for waiting for them."
238,98282,"The participant experienced an intense visual and auditory alteration following substance ingestion. Initially, their vision dissolved into swirling geometric patterns accompanied by a humming sound. They felt an overwhelming sense of euphoria and were drawn towards a bright white light at the center of these patterns. The experience then shifted to a grid-like environment with green lines similar to those in ""Tron,"" where they could see through their skin and observe psychedelic veins and helix patterns resembling DNA structures. After some time, the participant faded out and woke up feeling euphoric for several hours afterward."
239,102100,"The account begins with the individual smoking an unknown substance at a beach location, experiencing a tingling sensation spreading across their shoulders and feeling connected to nature. They later visit a property where they attempt to smoke the substance again but have a brief experience due to using a joint instead of a proper pipe. During this session, they see clear energy fields around another person and feel a strong connection.

Later that night, at an ecovillage/commune, the individual takes a larger dose from a specialized pipe. They report intense visual patterns and a sense of being immersed in energy currents. The visuals include concentric color patterns and an image resembling Shiva or Kali. The participant experiences moments from their past life, particularly focusing on childhood and teenage years spent communing with nature.

The trip reaches a climax when the individual confronts a symbolic wound, representing fears related to previous psychedelic experiences. They accept this fear and move through it, emerging into a realm of intense color and light. During this phase, they yell out their name repeatedly without realizing it and express a desire to be nude in the woods.

As the effects begin to wear off, the individual struggles with reorienting themselves and briefly panics, seeking help from someone who is not tripping. They eventually regain composure and engage in conversation about their experience, feeling empowered by the spiritual messages received."
240,76735,"The participant had two experiences in their living room setting. During the first session, they felt a sensation similar to nitrous oxide but with added visuals. Objects appeared to melt and have a wavy effect. After about five minutes, the effects subsided, and the participant felt nearly sober again.

In the second experience, which occurred a week later, the dosage was higher. Upon inhaling, the participant's arm appeared distorted, as if they could see their bones. The visuals intensified rapidly, leading to a state of confusion and fear. They saw strange clown-like figures similar to those in the movie ""Across the Universe."" It took about 15 minutes for the effects to subside, during which time the participant was unable to communicate clearly."
241,90906,"The participant began by smoking a substance mixed with tobacco using a metal pipe. After inhaling two deep hits and holding them in for about a minute, they noticed an initial change in perception before lying down to fully experience the effects. Closing their eyes, they saw vivid colors that transitioned into black kaleidoscopes and a dark spot perceived as evil.

Opening their eyes again, they felt intense fear and observed their room as if everything was alive and vibrating. The walls and objects appeared distorted; for example, the wall seemed to melt, and creases in clothing were visible and moving. A voice in their head repeated ""every crease matters.""

The experience then shifted to a vast desert where an entity with swirling red colors did not welcome them. After this, they entered what felt like a familiar space, encountering a circular entity composed of all colors, which communicated with the participant about letting go of fear and achieving peace.

Upon opening their eyes again, the participant returned to baseline but reported feeling extremely happy afterwards and looking forward to repeating the experience."
242,98541,"The participant began their experience in a dimly lit room with soothing music playing and incense burning. After inhaling DMT smoke, they lay down and closed their eyes. Initially, they perceived dark geometric patterns spiraling towards them, which were checkered black and white and resembled ferrofluid. These patterns transformed into what the participant interpreted as elves or similar entities, excitedly pointing to a destination.

The experience then shifted, with the participant feeling separated from their body while what seemed like their spirit traveled rapidly to the left through a tunnel-like space filled with white dots resembling stars. A neutral being appeared to be guiding this separation process, holding the physical body still while carrying the spirit away. The sensation of saliva and swallowing brought the participant back into their body.

Upon returning, the spiraling patterns reappeared at a distance but were no longer as intense or spiky as before. The experience concluded with a sense of reunion between mind, body, and spirit, though the participant felt transformed by the event and now viewed themselves differently."
243,89422,"The participant smoked a large dose of DMT mixed with oregano using a homemade pipe. The onset was immediate and overwhelming, catching them off guard. They saw 100 alien-like creatures in space that communicated through high-pitched screeches and wild waving gestures. These beings were neither hostile nor inviting but seemed to be punishing the participant for their recklessness. After an intense and chaotic phase filled with bright colors and shapes, the experience paused briefly before transitioning into a peaceful, dreamlike state characterized by sharp, cartoon-like visuals and a disconnected feeling from reality. The trip eventually faded back to normal consciousness."
244,94495,"The participant prepared their smoking device by layering tobacco and a small amount of a psychoactive substance before inhaling deeply. They experienced initial physical sensations such as vibrations and visual distortions, followed by intense geometric patterns filling their vision. After several inhalations, they felt as if they were traveling through a tunnel of lights.

In this altered state, the participant reported feeling detached from their body and surroundings, entering what seemed like an alternate reality with mathematical structures. They encountered dark figures with elongated heads that communicated telepathically in an unfamiliar language. These beings conveyed a sense of love and purpose for the encounter, showing the participant a station-like area where they could access different dimensional universes.

The experience concluded with visualizations of interconnected Aztec faces before returning to normalcy after approximately 7 minutes."
245,97496,"In a secluded mountain area, the individual sat by a creek and meditated before inhaling a plant extract from a glass one hitter. They experienced vivid colors and geometric shapes as well as increased energy flowing through their body. A feminine hummingbird spirit appeared to them, making eye contact and communicating telepathically. The participant did not fully understand the information conveyed but felt it was valuable for future use. After thanking the hummingbird repeatedly, they returned to sitting by the tree. The experience lasted approximately 15 minutes and left them feeling euphoric and cleansed. The next day, a group of hummingbirds were observed in the nearby field."
246,66551,"The participant began their experience by inhaling a substance through a pipe after loading it onto a bowl of weed. The onset was immediate, causing them to hand off the pipe due to dizziness. They then observed expanding patterns from bubbles in a nearby waterfall before taking another dose. After this second dose, they sat on a bench and saw vivid, intricate patterns forming in the underbrush that quickly shifted as their eyes focused.

The participant felt a head rush when standing up but found walking manageable. A sense of calm overcame them, making language unnecessary. They perceived every living thing with distinct auras and noticed trees dancing and waving. The world seemed serene and perfect during this phase.

After about 20 minutes, the participant left their group to lie in the grass, observing glowing clouds and finding pictures within them. Vision and mind returned to normal over the next ten minutes, but a general sense of calm and well-being persisted for the rest of the day."
247,111502,"The participant took a high dose of a psychedelic substance at around 11am and experienced vivid visual effects such as colors bleeding into each other and clouds forming vortex-like shapes. They engaged in philosophical discussions with friends about language, consciousness, and the nature of reality. Approximately five hours after the initial dose, they consumed another substance (DMT) while in an altered state.

During this second experience, the participant felt their consciousness split into two parts - one remaining connected to their physical body while the other journeyed through what was perceived as ""the beyond."" In this state, the participant encountered a being that appeared and changed form constantly, ranging from humanoid shapes to blobs, animals, and individual particles. The entity emitted an aura of pure light.

The being communicated with the participant using a harmonic sound that conveyed thoughts. It introduced itself as consciousness and explained its role in giving life on that plane of existence consciousness. It stated that it experiences everything its consciousnesses experience and processes all their thoughts and feelings before returning them to new lives. The entity also mentioned that there are other beings like itself in different planes of the dimension and multiverse, who share knowledge and cultivate understanding.

After this encounter, the participant's split consciousness re-integrated into a euphoric state. They shared their experiences with friends and continued discussing the implications of what they had learned during the remainder of their trip."
248,110504,"The participant experienced an intense transition into a different dimension characterized by streaks of light and energy ascending and descending infinitely. The campsite transformed into a hyperdimensional version of itself while retaining its recognizable features. An entity appeared to the left, facing forward towards the lake but angled slightly toward the participant. This entity was described as feminine in form with a long, curvy figure, approximately 10 feet tall, sitting on what resembled a beach lounge chair. It radiated yellow-green energy and communicated through a sense of raw understanding rather than spoken words.

The entity directed the participant's attention forward to show them an illusionary nature of material existence, emphasizing its temporary and less significant aspect compared to a higher-dimensional backdrop. The participant experienced death as part of this greater existence and felt immense joy and contentment. They perceived themselves as a small piece in a dynamic, growing mosaic, part of a grand scheme.

At one point, the participant realized they were one of these entities, leading to the dissolution of their ego and becoming part of the trip itself. As the experience began to end, there was a sense of temporary goodbyes, likened to leaving home for a business trip. The descent brought awe and gratitude as reality reassembled.

The overall duration felt longer than 15 minutes, with time losing relevance during the peak. After coming down, the participant sat reflecting on the experience for about an hour, filled with emotion and contemplating its profound impact."
249,100353,"The participant experienced a brightly lit room filled with constantly shifting shapes displaying vibrant, previously unseen colors. A female being emerged from the surroundings as details formed around her face. She was described as having a structural, hyper-dimensional appearance similar to Ganesh and conveyed timeless wisdom. The being and the room merged, reaching out to the participant until they embraced. The experience then transitioned into flashes of galaxies manipulated in four dimensions."
250,92219,"The participant had previously consumed the substance three times, each time experiencing vivid visuals and intense sensations but not achieving what they perceived as the full effect. On their fourth attempt, after being instructed on how to properly inhale the substance, they took a larger dose. They felt a rush of energy and were immediately immersed in an Aztec-like dimension with intricate patterns.

As the effects intensified, the participant covered themselves with a blanket, plunging into darkness. They experienced rapidly changing visual and sensory phenomena, followed by a period of nothingness where all senses seemed to cease. A presence then emerged within their mind, causing both fear and reassurance. The participant saw a faint light but chose not to approach it.

They entered a dark plane where they felt an explosion of knowledge and were shown concepts of salvation and damnation. They perceived this as communication from a superior being. Removing the blanket, the participant became overwhelmed with emotions, crying uncontrollably and feeling damned. They then had visions of reincarnation through the ceiling of their location.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling reborn and deeply contemplative about what they had experienced. They expressed it as one of the most spiritual experiences of their life, though struggled to fully comprehend or describe it."
251,111142,"The participant begins their experience by inhaling a substance through a vaporizer, feeling an immediate warm yet strange sensation. They see geometric patterns and structures in the form of cylinders with intricate designs and other three-dimensional objects. As they continue to inhale, the intensity increases, causing overwhelming sensations, loud buzzing in the ears, and rapid thoughts.

During a subsequent inhalation session, the participant experiences an even more intense feeling, with their hands appearing enormous and the room seeming like it might explode. They decide to stop smoking at this point, demonstrating control over the experience.

The participant then has a vision that replays giving money to a homeless woman earlier in the day. In this vision, the second woman reveals her true face as the participant's own, delivering a message about the importance of giving and choice in life. The vision includes a hallway with doors representing different life possibilities, a chalice rising from below with dice and playing cards, and the statement ""You are the master of your own destiny."""
252,88925,"The participant experienced intense visual and auditory sensations after inhaling a significant amount of the substance. They reported seeing vividly colored, animated beings that engaged in various activities such as singing, crying, and dancing. One entity was described as playing a green harp which resembled a pipe. The creatures were initially close and vibrant but became fainter and farther away as the experience progressed. After interacting with these entities for several minutes, the participant opened their eyes to find the world vibrating intensely before returning to a warm, fuzzy afterglow."
253,90006,"The participant experienced an intense psychedelic journey after inhaling a substance. Initially, everything became extremely bright, leading to what is known as the 'tunnel' phase. As this subsided, they found themselves in a different world where it was raining heavily. The river appeared to be vibrating intensely, and trees seemed to wave towards them excitedly. Grass near the river grew taller rapidly before their eyes, and blue pipe-cleaner-like structures were observed growing around various objects, including the participant.

The participant's perception of time changed significantly; what felt like a half-hour to 45 minutes lasted only about 10 minutes in reality. They also noted that they did not recognize one of their friends (Connor) during this experience and engaged in deep contemplation about life and the nature of existence. The point of view shifted, making them feel as if they were observing from a height of just two inches.

Upon returning to their original state, the participant was surprised by comments made by Miranda regarding the intensity of the experience. This left them feeling refreshed, similar to waking up from a restful nap."
254,90774,"The participant and their friend went on a hike and smoked a substance in a secluded area. During the first session, the participant experienced visual hallucinations of red tunnels expanding and contracting, along with lava-like imagery. They remained conscious of their friend's presence throughout this experience. In the second session, after consuming a larger dose, the participant felt extremely uncomfortable as if being touched by death. Three figures resembling bright Egyptian statues emerged: a father, mother, and child. The child presented an urn to the participant from which they were intended to drink before opening their eyes. After the trip, the participant initially felt depressed but later interpreted it as a sign from Jesus Christ."
255,72863,"The individual began their experience by inhaling a substance through a glass pipe while listening to electronic music. They felt an intense rush causing them to sit up straight and rub their chest as they exhaled. Their body felt liquid-like and they lost touch with reality, feeling more like concentrated energy than in their physical form.

Visuals included a never-ending grid of geometric shapes that were vibrant and rapidly changing colors. The shapes appeared three-dimensional and floating through space. As the experience progressed, music stopped and was replaced by someone speaking about a radio show, leading to thoughts of being in a radio station before returning to normal perception.

During the afterglow stage, stars became a focal point with an accompanying background glow. To their right, everything appeared black and white while lights changed colors when looked at directly. The participant communicated their experience to others present, noting that their voice sounded strange to them."
256,98670,"The participant prepared for a psychedelic experience by setting up an altar with various symbolic items including crystals, candles, and pictures. Before starting, they experienced mild effects from a small dose, feeling strange but not hallucinating. They then smoked a larger dose of the substance, which caused rapid onset of intense visual and auditory hallucinations.

The participant saw intricate glowing patterns emerging from darkness when closing their eyes. These visions were described as symmetrical and complex, resembling celtic or tibetan knotwork. The world around them appeared intensely real yet unfamiliar, with everything feeling significant and meaningful. They experienced a sense of time distortion, feeling that time had stopped.

Auditory hallucinations included a loud ringing sound that grew in intensity until it felt deafening. This was accompanied by physical sensations of intense energy and pressure. The participant felt as though they were on the brink of death or a profound transformation. 

During the experience, the participant reflected deeply on their life, relationships, and regrets. They chanted ""love"" to invoke compassion and aid in returning from the altered state. As the effects began to wane, visual distortions persisted including patterned rugs and glowing walls.

The trip lasted approximately 40 minutes before the participant felt they were coming down. They expressed a desire to repeat the experience while also feeling some trepidation about doing so again soon."
257,111056,"The participant initially smoked a small amount of substance mixed with tobacco but did not feel significant effects beyond feeling slightly unsteady. They then vaporized the remaining substance, experiencing intense visual and auditory hallucinations. Initially, they felt a rush similar to salvia, with everything appearing in neon colors like a cartoon. Their hand appeared pointy, almost snake-like.

The experience included rapid-fire thoughts and a strong vibration sensation in their head. The visuals were described as having an Egyptian theme with symbols aligned within geometric waves of color that moved left to right. This was followed by shifting shapes and a tunnel-like highway of energy translated into colors, where giant balls of colors seemed to move through tunnels changing size, shape, and color.

The participant sat in darkness for about 5 minutes after the peak experience, feeling grounded with their hands near their eyes and experiencing lingering visual effects from the afterglow. They reflected on fear, trust, and learned to deal with it head-on during this experience."
258,83597,"The participant began by preparing for the experience, ensuring they were comfortable and undisturbed. They smoked a substance and immediately felt a resonating noise in their ears and a bodily vibration. Crawling to a darker area of their backyard, they perceived the grass as an otherworldly spiked landscape. Their body felt transformed into an unfamiliar animal-like creature, with euphoric limb movements.

As they faced the sky, the full moon and clouds appeared as a beautiful sea, evoking overwhelming emotions that brought them to tears. The experience included a sense of amazement, peace, and love. As the effects wore off, they stood up and noticed the sky transitioning from dark blue to reddish purple before fading into black.

Upon returning inside, the participant felt confused about the time, as the experience seemed much longer than its actual duration of just over 10 minutes."
259,44787,"The individual began their experience by consuming an unknown substance in the company of a friend. They immediately noticed changes in perception, including kaleidoscopic and glittery vision, as well as intense sensations. The person quickly realized that the companion was unreliable and managed to separate from them while still under the influence.

In the park, they encountered an aboriginal man who became their guide during this experience. This guide helped maintain their balance and facilitated conversations with several individuals who approached them one after another. Each conversation involved deep personal sharing and honesty. The participant felt a strong sense of self and groundedness throughout these interactions.

The experience lasted until sunrise, leaving the individual feeling calm and centered in the following days."
260,95475,"The participant smoked an unknown substance using a bong, estimating the dose to be less than 50mg but possibly up to 100mg. They meditated before smoking and listened to music during the experience. After inhaling several hits, they felt a strong body high with vivid colors and fractal patterns appearing on surfaces in their room. A cartoonish nurse figure appeared, resembling a 3D computer rendering with manga-like features, spinning in space. This figure later transformed into a nurturing presence that resembled a bug or butterfly, extending its proboscis towards the participant. The experience was described as being cared for by benevolent beings and resulted in feelings of joy and peace."
261,93226,"The individual began their experience in a wooded campsite after consuming a substance mixed with herbs. They felt their body warm and tingle, and the surroundings appeared cartoon-like. After taking a larger dose, they entered an intergalactic space realm filled with geometric shapes in green, blue, and purple hues that morphed into tunnels.

The participant reported ascending through multiple realms before reaching a dome-shaped room where eight or nine goddesses stood in a circle, praying and spinning around. These entities were described as having the same geometric patterns and colors seen earlier. The goddesses told the individual they must find their way back on their own, which involved making intricate hand movements that felt powerful and guided them down from the higher realm.

Upon returning to reality, the participant continued slow, deliberate hand movements while feeling at peace with themselves and the world around them."
262,107654,"The participant experienced a structured journey involving multiple entities and environments after consuming an unknown substance. They were transported to a hallway where they rolled down on a gurney-like object, pushed by mechanical beings. These beings had energy-filled boxes in front of them and occupied sections of an office room. The participant asked the beings what they were doing, and their head was pushed up towards the ceiling, which opened like cubes earlier in the experience.

Looking upwards, the participant saw a giant entity stomping on them with a space-like sky visible above its head. This giant was different from the mechanical beings and did not possess the same energy. The participant then fell into a black abyss through a chute but was saved by one of the mechanical beings who threw them back onto the gurney.

The being then buzzed the participant's body with laser-like energy, causing a loud buzzing sensation throughout their bones and muscles. They were taken back down the hallway to the side they came from and burst through to the other side. The gurney turned into a cocoon, and the participant levitated gently back into their body.

Upon opening their eyes after the experience, which may have ended early, all objects in their house appeared to vibrate at super speed, indicating an altered perception of time."
263,81249,"The participant experienced visual distortions while sitting in a chair, focusing on a lamp. Their vision transformed into a tunnel filled with neon yellow structures and activities that resembled hospital or repair processes. The light from the lamp appeared as a flickering star at the end of the tunnel. Physical sensations included muscle juddering in the upper thighs and flashes of extreme cold.

The participant then saw their room again, but it was highly distorted. A large purple/blue dragon-like creature was sprawled on what corresponded to their computer table. The creature had multiple images of the computer monitor on its back, displaying bizarre motifs and texts. Neon energies swirled around the scene."
264,99864,"The participant visited a trusted friend's house to spend the night and consume various psychedelic substances. After taking LSD, they engaged in conversation and artwork creation with their friend. Later, they consumed 4-AcO-DMT, which facilitated emotional openness between them as they discussed personal matters and experienced empathetic effects.

Subsequently, the participant smoked DMT using a homemade device. With their eyes open during this phase, they observed static fractal patterns on a photo album that turned out to be hallucinations upon closer inspection. The room appeared transformed into a candy factory-like environment with each object having unique, colorful designs.

Closing their eyes led them to an immersive, whimsical space resembling a virtual reality candy shop. This area featured rhythmic, transforming mandala-like structures and was synesthetic, evoking the taste of candy. Upon returning to normal consciousness, they found that the fractal patterns on the photo album were hallucinations.

The experience concluded with further conversation, dancing, and completing their artwork while under the influence of remaining substances."
265,82065,"The participant began the experience in a garage setting with friends present. After inhaling vaporized substance from a pipe, they felt an initial rush characterized by a sense of being lifted out of their body while remaining aware and experiencing geometrical patterns and auras. This was followed by a period of intense visual and sensory experiences lasting approximately five minutes.

During this time, the participant saw evolving, spiraling, colorful visuals on two screens formed by a ceiling beam in the garage. They perceived faces or beings within these visuals and felt an aura or energy attempting to communicate with them, suggesting they needed to let go of their ties to reality and release fear of losing control.

At the end of the trip, the participant sat up feeling confused but mind-blown, observing intricate patterns on the garage floor that appeared as beautiful art. They attempted to describe their experience to a friend who had helped administer the substance, though communication was challenging due to residual effects.

The overall duration of perceptual effects lasted about an hour, with lingering impacts felt beyond this period."
266,78062,"The participant and their friend inhaled an unknown substance from a pipe during a birthday party. Upon the first inhalation, the participant experienced intense visual hallucinations with geometric patterns featuring eyes at intersections. The colors were warm, and there was no fear or anxiety; instead, the participant felt safe and secure as if being watched by a higher form. After exhaling, the participant laid on the floor for about five minutes, feeling detached from their body and surroundings.

The second inhalation produced a strong physical sensation but lacked the vivid visuals of the first experience. The third inhalation brought back the intense visual hallucinations with similar feelings of safety and security. Upon opening their eyes after this trip, the participant noticed lingering psychedelic effects such as moving shadows on the ceiling that resembled celestial bodies."
267,76862,"The participant, along with three others (J, A, C), took a low dose of a substance after consuming MAOIs in a suburban park setting. The MAOI was consumed around 1:00 PM, followed by DMT tea at approximately 1:35 PM. The dosage varied slightly among the participants based on body weight estimates.

Subtle effects were noticed about 20 minutes after consuming the DMT tea. These included a mild body high and an altered perception of surroundings without significant visual distortions or changes in color. The experience was described as being between mushrooms and LSD, but closer to mushrooms in intensity.

The group walked through a park where they engaged in activities like rolling down a grass hill. By 3:00 PM, C reported no longer feeling the effects, while others felt they were still experiencing peak effects from their second cup of tea. The experience concluded around 4:00 PM with no lasting negative side effects such as headaches or nausea."
268,77301,"The participant began their experience alone in their room after smoking a small dose of the substance. They experienced visual distortions where objects appeared alive and playful. Their vision stretched and pulled, with colors fluctuating and patterns spreading beyond boundaries. The participant saw an upside-down dead person hanging from drapes near their door.

After waiting for the effects to wear off, they smoked another joint containing a higher dose of the substance along with marijuana and hashish. As the high set in, they heard a rising high-pitched sound before experiencing intense visual hallucinations characterized by flashing balls of light and distorted vision pulling in different directions.

During this intense phase, the participant encountered a human presence near them but could not recognize the face. They were clinging to stairs and felt slightly disoriented. After stumbling outside into a rainy courtyard, they continued to experience visual distortions caused by the wind until the effects began to subside."
269,74368,"The participant had two drug-induced experiences involving the consumption of a psychoactive substance. In the first experience, after consuming another substance (likely acid), the participant found a yellow bucket and a basketball that fit perfectly inside it. They felt protective over these objects and attributed significant meaning to them. While holding the ball in the bucket, they smoked a herbal mixture and experienced vivid visual hallucinations involving colors and hieroglyphic-like patterns on the basketball's surface.

In the second experience, at a music festival after consuming another substance (likely acid) and one pill found on the ground, the participant later smoked another herbal mixture. This time, their visual experiences involved seeing people in front of them turn bright colors (pink, purple, green), observing their clothing patterns as if they were from a cartoon or jazz album cover, and perceiving the sky as a grid mapped out by colored shapes."
270,70744,"The participant experienced a prolonged onset of effects after consuming caapi, Syrian Rue extract, and DMT extract. Initially, they felt apprehensive but eventually entered a deep trance several hours into the session. During this period, they encountered a powerful, slightly menacing sensation that prompted purging difficulties due to an apparent clash between the caapi and Syrian Rue.

The experience was characterized by intense feelings of terror and a primal, animalistic response from their brain, overriding more advanced cognitive functions. The participant perceived the Syrian Rue as dark and enveloping, contrasting with the light associated with caapi. For about an hour, the trip resembled a chaotic DMT experience without clear guidance or frame of reference.

Music played a supportive role in navigating the intense sensations. During peak experiences, all participants were deeply entranced and became aware of a humming sound, reminiscent of ""ommmm."" The participant speculated that this might be related to a cosmic tuning fork effect, representing the oscillation of matter and energy.

The experience lasted approximately 5-6 hours and was described as one of the strangest and most interesting by the participant."
271,77922,"The participant inhaled an unknown substance four times through a bong while lying down in bed. After inhalation, they experienced vivid and impossible visions. Entities appeared to the participant, saying ""hi"" and then ""goodbye."" As the experience concluded, the participant felt as though they were being reborn and reconnected with their identity. The sensations of breakthrough and impossibility were noted but quickly forgotten as reality became clear again."
272,69023,"The individual began their experience by administering a substance rectally and experienced mild burning sensations followed by tingling in their fingers. Nausea was felt for about 20 minutes before subsiding. They then engaged in conversation and activities at a rehearsal space, noting enhanced social interactions and enjoyment of drumming under the influence.

Visual effects included fractals and geometric shapes. The experience with DMT involved vivid imagery: two figures wearing purple and white body suits appeared behind geometric shapes, followed by oscillating colors reminiscent of stained glass. The participant was instructed to visualize various adjectives, which altered the visuals accordingly. A voice advised them not to be hard on themselves for not excelling in certain areas, suggesting they use their unique brain function to their advantage.

The experience concluded with a restful sleep and feeling refreshed upon waking."
273,70238,"A participant conducted an experiment to assess the effectiveness of administering a psychoactive substance via transdermal DMSO application. They started with low doses (5mg) of freebase form dissolved in 80% DMSO, applied to the wrist, and observed no effects. Increasing the dose up to 75mg also yielded no noticeable impact. The participant then tried a salt form of the substance at 50mg on the forearm, noting slight irritation but only a possible increase in heart rate after about five minutes. No other significant physical or psychological effects were reported."
274,23164,"The participant and a friend ingested an unknown quantity of a substance by inhaling smoke from it. The participant experienced intense sensations characterized by rapidly accelerating thoughts and extreme intensity. They reported feeling as though they had undergone some form of initiation or transformation, although the specifics were unclear. During this period, the participant's behavior included rocking back and forth, making swimming-like motions with their arms, drooling, and murmuring incoherently. The experience lasted approximately 30-45 minutes, during which time the participant was unaware of their surroundings and unable to communicate effectively. Afterward, they felt extremely pleased but also unsure about the amount consumed and its effects."
275,41041,"The individual experienced a substance-induced trip on two occasions. In the first instance, after inhaling vaporized DMT through a water bong with damiana, they felt their body sensations heightened and perceived sharper colors in the external world. Closing their eyes led to visual hallucinations of an ancient mural that transformed into a high-rise car park setting. From the pillars emerged entities resembling young ravers or nymphs, neither distinctly male nor female, who approached the individual with welcoming yet slightly mischievous expressions. The experience was accompanied by music and rapidly shifting lights. Upon opening their eyes, they noticed enhanced clarity in everyday objects.

In the second instance, while on a beach at night after consuming more DMT, the individual experienced auditory hallucinations where sounds disappeared, leaving only visual perception. They perceived an expanded horizon filled with vibrant colors of blue and purple, accompanied by a light chime sound. The clarity of distant lights and natural surroundings like pine trees and boats was significantly enhanced, creating a sense of awe and evolutionary advancement in their visual perception."
276,63786,"The participant began by snorting a dose of a substance, experiencing immediate visual effects characterized by vibrant colors and geometric patterns. They communicated coherently with others in the room while feeling euphoric but less intensely than previously experienced substances. The group then used nitrous oxide, enhancing the existing visuals.

Next, the participant smoked DMT. As they exhaled after the third hit, their body tingled and felt as if being pulled towards something. Room surroundings appeared unreal with patterns covering everything. Friends' faces turned into skeletons. Closing eyes revealed huge, revolving 3D wheels of geometric shapes that exploded into neon pink and blue arrows.

Opening eyes again, the participant found themselves in an orange/red box resembling Hell. A devil-like figure emerged from a warping floor and dove into their face. They reported losing all sense of existence, gaining universal knowledge which then slipped away instantly. Upon returning to reality, they felt glad to be human again.

The close-eye visuals were reactivated with nitrous oxide. About 20 minutes later, no DMT effects remained, but the initial substance's effects continued. To calm down, the participant took Valium and ketamine. The rest of the night was spent talking, and sleep came easily around 4am."
277,41040,"The participant began feeling tired and experiencing some residual effects from an earlier substance use. They lit up and felt their body become sluggish as they leaned back into the experience. A colorful sphere resembling an underground nightclub appeared, filled with friendly but confused-looking cartoonish figures. These entities spoke to the user quickly, giving a sense of reassurance before walking away. The participant then saw metallic shapes that melted together endlessly, creating awe-inspiring visuals. The colors eventually dissipated, leaving behind a clear and sharp sensation."
278,34523,"The participant inhaled a vaporized substance and experienced vivid visuals characterized by unusual shapes and colors that seemed to explode into hyper-detailed patterns. This led to an encounter with two beings resembling large praying mantises within what appeared to be an alien spaceship-like room. The beings were aware of the participant's presence, though they did not explicitly communicate verbally. The participant felt insignificant compared to the grand scheme these entities were part of and sensed a watchful but distant attitude towards human life. The experience concluded with a sense that this realm was more than just a chemical reaction and that further visits would depend on the beings' approval."
279,53698,"The participant initially had little interest in trying the substance but eventually acquired it through an unexpected encounter at a bar. After conducting research, they decided to try it alone for their first experience. They smoked a small amount and felt a warm buzz with some visual effects similar to those of LSD. Later, they tried again with a friend present.

During the second attempt, after inhaling a larger dose, the participant experienced an intense rush characterized by vivid colors and complex geometric patterns. The environment appeared cartoonish, and they saw creatures resembling elves. A formless blue entity appeared, displaying hieroglyphic-like symbols at high speed. The participant felt overwhelming concern for their friend's well-being during this experience.

As the effects began to wane, the participant experienced a profound sense of euphoria and felt humbled by what they had witnessed. They reported that the experience changed their perception of reality positively. Their friend also tried a small amount but only experienced slight hallucinations."
280,39840,"The participant engaged in multiple sessions of inhalation of an unidentified substance while camping in a wilderness area. During the first session, they observed vivid, patterned colors that morphed into the profile of the Egyptian God Sekhmet before fading away. The experience was characterized by feelings of relaxed calm and serene beauty.

On another night, after inhaling the substance, the participant knelt by a river and experienced intense visual patterns. They saw winged insect-like creatures with feathered wings and multi-faceted eyes that appeared to observe them closely but did not communicate verbally. The vision included a realm where these creatures resided, along with complex patterned light curtains flowing down the valley, featuring faces of 'Kings' leading the flow.

The participant also noted seeing overlaid patterns and animal forms on trees around the river. They observed May flies flying about, which when focused upon, revealed intricate patterned lights with embedded faces and animals.

In a separate account by another individual (Butch), they described visual experiences including spinning wheels resembling chakras, a 3D pyramid in a square frame, and a large millipede moving down the valley. The environment was filled with tall grasses and insects with purple translucent legs. A flying saucer or blimp was seen further down the valley. They also experienced entering a cave with yellow stalagmites that transformed into floating sting rays and later found themselves in what appeared to be someone's house or museum, where they saw multi-colored patterned transparent Mexican objects on shelves."
281,24526,"In the fall of 2002, on the shores of Kootney Lake in Canada, the participant experienced a profound journey after inhaling a substance. Upon exhaling, they heard a strange radio frequency combined with crackling noises. They felt as if time had stopped and were immersed in a world filled with infinite knowledge and beauty.

The participant communicated with orb-like creatures that formed patterns and seemed to guide them. These entities appeared close and then came together in formations, almost as if instructing the participant to follow their movements. The experience lasted approximately 10 minutes but felt like an eternity.

Visions of sacred geometry were also present during this journey. The participant felt overwhelmed with a sense of infinite knowledge about how the world truly is and experienced profound love that they believed could manifest into anything desired.

Upon returning from the experience, the participant felt reborn and assured by a universal force that everything was okay in the world. They were reminded that their higher self had chosen to experience physical form on Earth and that through love, one can understand who they are."
282,27841,"The experience began with a period of no noticeable effects despite multiple doses being consumed. At around 50 minutes after the last dose, visual effects started to appear. Initially, there was a simple scene featuring a duck pecking at the participant's chin near a peaceful lake. This was followed by more complex and intense visuals (OEVs) approximately ten minutes later.

The peak of the experience lasted about 50 minutes during which the participant felt cold and experienced nausea, leading to purging. After this peak, there were two additional stages: one lasting around five minutes with a lower intensity flash experience, followed by another hour-long period of diminishing effects.

Throughout the trip, the participant reported feeling extremely good towards the end, attributing it neither to mind nor body but rather to spirit. Physical sensations included heavy breathing and thrashing about during the peak phase."
283,27713,"The participant met a friend who had obtained DMT. They prepared tea and coffee before smoking a small joint and then using the DMT. The participant experienced an immediate rush similar to Salvia D. During the peak of the trip, they saw black walls that turned into primary colors and felt dizzy as if traveling like a light ray. They heard a whirring sound resembling whale or dolphin communication. The participant's head felt as though it was rocking back and forth, and they experienced intense visual effects even with their eyes closed. There were feelings of euphoria and cleansing. After the trip, they felt energetic, mellow, and happy for almost two weeks."
284,21482,"The participant experienced involuntary arm movements resembling complex yoga positions during the trip. These movements were associated with specific states of consciousness characterized by colors and geometric patterns. Additionally, strange sounds and vocalizations emerged from their mouth involuntarily, which seemed to alter the overall color scheme of their hallucinations. The participant noted a resemblance between these vocalizations and glossolalia described by Terence McKenna. They also observed that one shape in their hallucination was actually a high-pitched sound resembling an ancient Indian Tantric motif known as Kali yantra, leading them to believe the experience is based on molecular harmonics of sound waves rather than visual interpretation."
285,20182,"The participant experienced intense auditory hallucinations characterized by increasing buzzing sounds before visual hallucinations began. They perceived the world in 4D, feeling overwhelmed by its complexity and fearing they might never return to their previous perception of reality. The experience included encountering entities such as a girl in costume and DJ Nitro's arms, who communicated with them during the trip. These interactions were described as frightening and emotionally intense. The visuals were not just optical illusions but felt like changes in reality itself. The trip lasted approximately 15 minutes, followed by an acid-like visual experience."
286,20763,"The participant prepared for their experience by creating a sacred circle and engaging in meditation. They then took a dose of the substance from another individual named Chris. Upon inhaling deeply, they noticed changes in their visual perception, such as patchy patterns on their hands. As the effects intensified, they entered an altered state where everything around them appeared to be woven into intricate, colorful patterns.

The participant observed Chris transforming before their eyes, with his features disassembling and reconfiguring into a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes. They also perceived a female entity resembling Cleopatra, whom they identified as themselves in another form. The backyard transformed into a vibrant, ever-changing landscape filled with living tapestries, plastic-looking plants, and shifting colors.

The participant became aware that they were experiencing an induced reality while still perceiving the physical world through webs of energy and crystalline structures. They interacted with Chris during this state, sharing their wonder and appreciation for the experience. The participant also encountered a golden serpent entity under a plant in the backyard, which they identified as Chicchan.

The entire experience lasted approximately 5-7 minutes but left the participant feeling profoundly affected and euphoric long after the effects had worn off."
287,20293,"The participant extracted a substance from plant material using chemical processes and then smoked 100 mg of it. During the experience, they encountered entities described as ""symbiotic crystals."" These entities communicated in English and identified themselves as the essence of consciousness and builders of universal mind. They were friendly towards those who wished to interact with them and presented themselves as a self-organized structure driving novelty and creativity in the universe."
288,19872,"The participant began their experience by preparing a substance in a bowl and inhaling it deeply. Immediately after inhalation, they noticed the ceiling bending and walls liquefying into colorful puddles that hardened into ice. The couch then buckled, propelling them into a world of geometric shapes and vibrant colors.

In this new environment, the participant observed themselves as geometric forms composed of triangles and squares. This world began to melt, leading them through a breathing hallway that cycled through various colors at increasing speeds until they encountered blue-colored fire. The fire was nurturing and soothing, pushing the participant into a liquid-like substance within a complex clock.

The clock's surface disappeared as the participant fell through green and blue hues into tie-dyed pools of liquid. Upon hitting this glass-like liquid, it shattered into millions of pieces, revealing only glass. After landing, they found themselves back in their living room, with walls rising to cover the other world, seemingly regretful.

The room transitioned from dark to bright as a white light emanated from the bowl. The participant remained on the sofa for an extended period until the kaleidoscope visuals faded and normalcy returned."
289,19626,"The participant smoked a mixture of DMT and marijuana with three friends after returning from Burning Man. They experienced visual hallucinations characterized by pristine, impossible-to-describe colors that veiled their surroundings in light and meaning. The combination allowed them to remain grounded in reality while still engaging with the intense visuals.

At one point during the experience, they felt overwhelmed and grabbed a sober friend's arm for grounding. This action helped dissipate the menacing feeling. They saw a giant neon spider-like being from the inside out, moving through its multi-bladdered heart. The being communicated with them, teaching surrender and showing them how to let the experience come over them.

The physical sensation was described as orgasmic, extending beyond the body into the soul, heart, and mind. The marijuana helped provide control and receptiveness during the experience. After coming down from the trip, they felt in a good mood for about an hour, filled with energy and wanting to sing and dance."
290,12336,"The participant experienced an intense visual and auditory journey after inhaling a substance through a pipe. Initially standing, they fell due to dizziness and received minor injuries. Upon lying down, their vision centered around a vibrating, textured white surface that transformed into rapidly moving eyes resembling those on the cover of Tool's album ""Aenema."" These eyes then materialized into human-like forms with characteristics of Superman and ET.

The entities communicated in an unfamiliar language which the participant understood perfectly. They repeated phrases like ""ooba dooba"" before transitioning to recognizable speech, including a query about the participant's well-being. The voices were described as metallic and muppet-like until they became their friend's voice, signaling the end of the experience. The trip lasted approximately 8-9 minutes, followed by a euphoric state lasting around 45 minutes."
291,14634,"The participant experienced a drug trip characterized by a dream-like state and vivid, colorful visuals reminiscent of ayahuasca. The visuals included fractal patterns of light. No interactions with entities were reported during the trip."
292,12509,"The individual inhaled an unknown substance and held their breath for 30 seconds. They noticed visual blurring around the edges of objects and a rippling effect on walls. Their heart rate increased, and they felt a racing sensation. To manage this, they lay down with headphones on and focused on their heartbeat.

During the experience, the participant became highly aware of their body, particularly focusing on back pain and using visualization techniques to relax tight muscles. They imagined unwinding knots in their muscles and experienced relief from the pain. The individual also noticed how their posture had been altered due to extra weight and corrected it during the trip.

The mental content was minimal, with only a few random thoughts and visualizations (CEVs). They were able to focus on background music playing through headphones. The mood remained neutral throughout the experience without any euphoria or significant changes in emotion.

No encounters with entities were reported. The effects lasted for about 10 minutes before gradually fading over an hour. The participant felt that this was a beneficial experience, particularly regarding their back pain and posture awareness, but did not feel it met their expectations."
293,3175,"The participant was in their room watching TV when two friends arrived. After consuming an unknown substance, the individual experienced intense visual and auditory hallucinations. Their vision rose above them as if they were dropping fast, and they felt a buzzing sensation that increased rapidly. The participant became scared and asked who the people around them were and what was happening.

They then entered another plane of existence, believing they had died due to the intensity of the experience. After emerging from this state, their vision returned slowly, with everything blurring before focusing again. They saw a spinning circular object in front of their face, which turned out to be a fan. The participant could see transparent membranes over their friends' bodies and felt pure love emanating from within them.

They tried to communicate but stumbled over their words, eventually asking what the substance was. Their friends mentioned it was called a 'Business Man's Trip,' though they did not know the specific name of the drug used."
294,2964,"The participant experienced several drug-induced visual phenomena while lying in their bed. The visuals were vivid and transformed into detailed scenes and entities. In one vision, they saw what they called the 'flower god', a human-like figure with an enormous, three-dimensional flower head that approached another inert person to display its beauty. Another vision featured a corpse lying upright in an ancient coffin, with fractal flowers blooming from it as energy flowed through its body. During a subsequent experience, a shadow lady appeared and blew colorful patterns into the participant's mouth. The visuals were described as intensely beautiful, geometrically intricate, and three-dimensional."
295,2799,"The participant experienced a vivid visual phenomenon where looking to the right revealed frowning faces in a symmetrical fractal pattern, while looking left showed smiling faces, creating an opposite image. These faces represented duality and asked the participant to choose between them, emphasizing that both were true but also contradictory. The participant became stuck in this paradox, oscillating between the two perspectives.

The experience then expanded to include what felt like a conversation with the universe or a higher entity, which presented the concept of duality as fundamental to life and existence. This entity expressed frustration at the participant's inability to resolve the paradox and suggested that the experiment was nearing its end. The setting appeared as a small room deep underground in a labyrinthine structure, everything in black and white.

Other beings were present, described as mischievous but friendly. These entities did not seem omniscient but rather curious about the participant's experience. The universe or entity explained that duality is evident everywhere (e.g., heaven/hell, rich/poor) and that this was an ancient experiment nearing completion.

The participant promised to help discern the answer to the eternal question of duality and returned to their normal state, feeling scared but thankful for life. Upon returning, they noticed everything had extra layers when looked at closely, and they could see through objects like their hand. They talked aloud about not forgetting the experience and helping to decide between the dualities.

The participant was unsure whether they were supposed to accept that life is this way or try to help choose one side over the other. The experience left them questioning the purpose of existence and the role of time, matter, and consciousness in resolving fundamental paradoxes."
296,2327,"The experience began when the individual inhaled an unknown substance from a pipe. Immediately after inhalation, they found themselves on the floor, experiencing visual distortions that included mosaic patterns. They saw large chopping tools like knives and axes cutting up what appeared to be molecules forming into a new dimension made of colors and sounds.

A large monster with white teeth and saliva then appeared in front of them. The monster dissolved into a black hole, which also sucked the individual inside. During this journey through the black hole, they felt a strong sense of unity with everything around them and experienced intense emotions of love and peace. They perceived themselves as part of an infinite universe, seeing and feeling everything simultaneously.

The experience concluded abruptly, leaving the individual on the floor feeling weird but happy."
297,1856,"The participant started by smoking a small dose but did not achieve the desired effect. They then smoked another 20mg dose, which produced a strong and rapid onset of effects. Initially, they perceived intricate geometric patterns on the glass pipe before their consciousness was altered entirely. The experience included passing through a dense sea of energy waves and observing cross-sections of these vibrational conduits.

The participant experienced simultaneous perceptions of various life events, including their own birth, death, and the births of their daughter and future son. Their awareness shifted between cosmic observation and physical reality, with the latter becoming increasingly disconnected from the former. They noted that their body had drooped in their hand and was drooling during this time.

As the experience progressed, the participant's consciousness gradually returned to the present moment, but they remained highly altered. The room appeared trippy, leading them to question whether these surroundings always looked so vivid or if they would remain this way permanently. They briefly considered existential questions about life and death before deciding to wait out the effects.

The overall experience was described as personal and connected, with no sense of encountering alien entities or elves."
298,1848,"The individual smoked a substance from a pipe and experienced rapid onset effects within seconds. They heard a buzzing tone that grew louder until it was the only sound they could perceive. The visual field became obscured by layers of overlapping patterns, leading to sensory overload. The participant felt as if their being had been scattered into pieces and then slowly reformed over five minutes.

During this period, there were jumbled visuals including fantasies, memories, and geometric forms mixed with elements from the room. There was a sense of 'other' presence but no specific entities were seen or interacted with directly. The participant's eyes alternated between open and closed during the experience, though they did not notice any difference.

As the effects wore off, the individual felt happy and amused. The room appeared yellow-orange in color, and the ceiling seemed to be moving. After another five minutes, they were ready to speak and sit up. They noted difficulty recalling details from the experience, suggesting an internal censoring effect that limited what could be brought back."
299,1847,"The participant sat in a meditative position and consumed the substance. Their physical surroundings disappeared, replaced by a field of reddish-brown hues moving in all directions. A hole opened up, revealing a suspended rose quartz crystal above their head. The crystal was filled with an orange-yellow liquid that pulsed and emitted millions of microscopic light strands, which refracted from the uncut stone's edges and felt like they were cascading over the participant's face and body. After about 10 minutes, the scene faded but left a lingering perception of energy emanating from the crystal."
300,1846,"Two friends hiked into the Great Smokey Mountains during spring break and took an unknown substance before smoking cannabis dusted with another substance. They sat by a creek surrounded by lush forest and experienced vivid hallucinations of elves, faeries, and other nature spirits. These entities were described as diminutive and playful, some flirtatious and erotic. The narrator saw insects flying along energetic lines in the air that he could perceive. He felt connected to these beings and believed they might be related to aliens or interstellar travelers. After about half an hour, the hallucinations of free-moving spirits faded, leaving the narrator with a heightened appreciation for nature's hidden patterns and figures."
301,1844,"The participant consumed an unknown substance and experienced vivid hallucinations. They were transported to a room filled with spirits who greeted them with cheers. These entities then engaged in various behaviors, including taunting and offering a choice involving cutting off the participant's head for knowledge and an intense rush. The participant rejected this offer and was subsequently pulled from an altar by what they believed to be their guardian angel to a peaceful place. This experience included visual and auditory hallucinations as well as physical sensations like energy rushes and warmth. Upon opening their eyes, the participant could see the spiritual energy of their girlfriend."
302,1840,"The individual began feeling nervous anticipation as they prepared for the experience. After inhaling from a pipe, they immediately felt stunned and disoriented. They perceived a person in their field of vision as having limbs that resembled elongated springs. As the effects intensified, reality rapidly fragmented, and the participant became more disoriented.

During this period, intense flashes of solid pure colors were experienced regardless of whether the eyes were open or closed. The individual also reported difficulty breathing and hearing distorted sounds, which seemed to come from random directions and inside their head. They felt detached terror throughout much of the experience.

After an extended period of altered perception, normal cognitive reality gradually returned in waves. The participant became aware that they were lying with their head thrown back and mouth open. As reality slowly reasserted itself, trivial visual distortions and pattern hallucinations appeared on surfaces like carpets and walls."
303,118297,"The individual began their journey by inhaling the substance and experiencing loud ticking sounds followed by a black curtain over their eyes. A thunderstorm with flashing green and purple lights ensued, creating an immersive environment. As they let go of fear, they entered a fractal world resembling an infinite Tetris game, filled with various landscapes such as buildings, streets, seas, and mountains.

A dark shadowed figure appeared, stating ""you are who you are"" and asking if the participant believed in it now. The entity offered eternal love if the participant loved it back. As everything began to fade, the individual was aggressively pulled back towards the entity but then cast back into the fractal world, this time traveling backwards.

The experience concluded with the participant returning to their room, feeling confused and amnesic initially. Upon opening their eyes, they perceived a grid covering everything, tied together by love. Slowly, reality returned, leaving them with a spiritual awakening and the belief that God had shown himself in all his glory."
304,116807,"The participant describes two experiences with an unnamed substance. In the first experience, after inhaling the substance, they immediately feel intense vibrations and enter what is described as a ""DMT dimension."" The visual aspect was less pronounced than expected, but there was a strong sinister vibe present. The only comforting element was music playing in the background. After about 10 minutes, the trip began to fade when fresh air was breathed in through an open window, though lingering dark vibes persisted until they stared at a pentagram on their wall.

In the second experience, several days later and after consuming additional substances (gabapentin and alcohol), the participant ingested a smaller dose of the substance. This time, the visual effects were more pronounced, with closed-eye visuals depicting a room with a grid floor where each square had menacing faces at its corners. Pillars and a ceiling similar in design to the floor completed the scene. The overall feeling was threatening, without any sense of comfort or belonging. Opening their eyes provided relief as they could see the setting sun outside, which served as a source of comfort during the trip that lasted about 5 minutes."
305,116241,"The participant experienced two DMT sessions, each with multiple stages of increasing visual complexity. In the first session, the walls of the room began to display 3D geometric shapes, which then filled the entire space. The visuals included intricate mechanical gears and machinery-like structures that seemed to expand and transform continuously. As the experience progressed, the environment itself appeared to deform and melt, with a strong sense of reality fading away. At its peak, the room was filled with hyperdimensional 3D and possibly 4D geometric shapes, overwhelming the participant's vision.

In the second session, after an initial disappointing stage, the participant achieved a breakthrough where the external world began to break apart and transform into intricate geometric patterns. The experience involved extreme scenery slicing, where parts of the environment separated and exploded upwards, creating trails of geometric pieces. There was also a sensation of falling or floating in an airy ether, with buildings around the house appearing to rise up. Throughout both sessions, the participant maintained clear-headedness despite the intense visual hallucinations."
306,115976,"The participant ingested a large dose of an unknown substance through a gravity bong. Initially, they experienced visual distortions such as blurring vision and seeing shapes and colors. They felt a sensation of cells being pulled off their body, leading to a loss of bodily awareness. In the altered state, the user observed historical events in third-person perspective, including a scene at Chichen Itza where a shaman was decapitated by slaves. A Mayan god-like entity appeared, confronting the user about their presence and commanding them to leave. Upon returning to reality, the room morphed in and out of itself like jello. The participant felt happy and content with being human again, appreciating the single death that humans face."
307,115790,"The participant reported seeing entity dancers with black outlines that were fluorescent red and green, similar to the movie Tron. These entities faded quickly, prompting the participant to continue using a vape pen in an attempt to join them. The participant experienced their body being ""obliterated"" or folded into itself, accompanied by a sensation of urination and complete silence. They perceived themselves as pure consciousness without eyes, body, room, planet, or any physical form.

In this state, the only presence was that of thoughts, which would manifest visually when thought about. For example, thinking of a human led to visualizing a woman holding a baby with a tree of life nearby. The participant believed they had died and were in an afterlife realm where consciousness created reality. They attempted to recreate a 3D world by projecting it, which helped them calm down.

Eventually, the participant regained awareness of their surroundings but saw fragments that resembled paintings. They managed to stand up, leave their room, and walk outside as the experience began to fade."
308,115566,"The participant conducted a ceremony involving vaporized substance with two friends in a prepared setting. After inhaling the substance three times, they entered a vivid hallucinatory realm resembling a colorful village inhabited by at least 50 entities living peacefully. The participant crossed a wooden rope bridge guided by an entity that appeared as semi-transparent energy without facial features. Upon reaching the other side of the bridge, the guide vanished, and the participant observed an older male entity tending to a large, semi-transparent energy worm in a transparent box. After shouting for knowledge, the sky transformed into decorative, colorful hands with eyes, waving and appearing amused."
309,115564,"The participant experienced entering a distinct realm described as a ""Waiting World"" that had a doughnut-like shape with a ceiling above it. This world was modern and bright, featuring market stalls indicative of an economy. The beings in this world were made of energy and crystal fractals, varying in shapes and sizes, suggesting multiple species.

A tall female entity, also composed of crystal fractals and energy, approached the participant after noticing them. She observed the participant with suspicion but allowed them to continue exploring while closely following and supervising to prevent any trouble. The encounter was silent, with the female entity seemingly ensuring the participant's safety and compliance through non-verbal communication."
310,94673,"The participant sat on their bed after inhaling a high dose of an unknown substance. Initially, they felt their heart pounding but continued with the experience. As the effects set in, the room transformed into something unrecognizable, filled with rapidly changing colors primarily blue, red, and yellow. The environment became extremely quiet.

Two entities appeared, described as self-transforming shapes or ""machine elves."" These entities communicated through thoughts transferred to the participant's mind rather than spoken words. They expressed irritation towards the participant and conveyed that this experience was a form of punishment for negative actions in their past. The entities stepped on the participant repeatedly, causing intense physical and emotional pain.

The participant experienced multiple ego deaths during these interactions. When they opened their eyes, reality seemed distorted with everything appearing to overlay each other. After several minutes, the participant returned to normal consciousness but felt that a part of their awareness remained in the altered state.

Thoughts before the experience included feeling invincible and capable of handling the effects. During the trip, the participant realized the need for more respect towards the substance and decided to take breaks from using it in the future due to its intensity."
311,100618,"The participant reported lying in bed at night after smoking a substance. Within 30 seconds, they heard a soothing ringing sound inside their head that increased in pitch. They saw two large yellow objects made of millions of light cubes arranged into 3D shapes in their peripheral vision. These cubes then exploded apart to form a massive black dome-shaped space filled with neon lines and patterns.

In this space, the participant encountered an entity they referred to as the ""cosmic clown."" This entity was described as very tall, neon green, with a free-floating head and hands but no visible body. The cosmic clown had a huge smile and used its hands to morph and change colors of an object it held between them. The experience lasted until the participant started coming down from the effects, at which point they sat up in awe and thanked the entity.

The second encounter with the cosmic clown was similar but allowed for more detailed observation of the entity's features."
312,108415,"The participant began to feel anxious before consuming the substance, which led to a rapid onset of effects. Their vision became crystal clear and time seemed to slow down. As they took more hits, their body high intensified and their eyes felt heavy. They perceived an expansion of consciousness into infinity while simultaneously shrinking to an infinitesimal point.

In the darkness behind closed eyelids, the participant saw what appeared to be a shimmering, multicolored river of information with distinct intelligence or personality. This was accompanied by electronic grinding sounds that morphed into robot screams. The river of information transformed into their face and then melted, causing intense fear as if all the universe's information was being forced into their skull.

After about two and a half minutes, the participant felt in danger and experienced rising nausea. They vomited out the car window while still highly affected by the substance. It took approximately an hour for them to return to baseline physically but remained mentally stunned by the experience."
313,104685,"The participant and a friend prepared for an experience in a calm setting at home. The friend had a shorter initial experience with closed-eye visuals but did not break through to another realm. The main participant then took a larger dose and experienced rapid onset of colorful fractal patterns before encountering an entity described as a jester. This being performed intricate dances and revealed a cube-like portal containing three other beings made of dark green liquid. These beings melted away, leaving the jester to guide the participant through a multidimensional space known as the ""folding room."" The experience concluded with the participant re-entering their physical body, still processing intense visuals and emotions."
314,94973,"On Friday night, the participant smoked a small amount of substance while listening to trip-hop music, experiencing vivid visuals that enhanced their enjoyment. They went to bed early due to red eyes from smoking.

Saturday morning, after eating remaining mushrooms and sitting by the window, they experienced visual distortions and emotional upliftment as 'The Doors' played in the background.

Sunday evening, the participant attempted DMT use with a vaporizer and pipe but had limited success. After smoking weed with a friend, they used a bong and eventually achieved a breakthrough experience on DMT. During this trip, they experienced visual patterns that formed into a face which felt sinister but was soothed by directing female energy towards it.

The participant then had a profound realization about the uniqueness and transience of life, feeling empathy for others including their boss. They entered a room described as both familiar and real, where all past experiences were transient clips from this eternal place. The realization that existence is in this room felt profoundly real but also awkward and creepy due to its implications.

They faintly remembered seeing a white figure and taking the shape of a meditating monk before returning to their body with strong emotions. After opening their eyes, they experienced disrupted senses and heard comments from others about their trip phases, though these were not actually spoken by them.

The participant felt that even if they didn't break through to the other side, the visuals during the first phase of the DMT trip were very nice, but the 'room' experience was the most surreal feeling of existence they had ever experienced."
315,92971,"The participant inhaled smoke from a bowl containing resinous material and experienced immediate visual effects. They saw green laser beams drifting around the room before noticing a red flickering light from across the room that appeared to move towards them inside a neon green tube. The sensation was as if their eyeballs had left their head, traveling to the top of the lamp.

The participant's vision then shifted to see various instruments about 3 feet tall performing tricks with balls of light on the floor. They noticed a mural of an alien creature that transformed from a painting into a living entity, approximately 7 feet tall with three heads, six arms, and dozens of eyes. The alien communicated telepathically and showed the participant neon tracks leading to another dimension.

In this new dimension, there were shapes resembling bars, ladders, and tracks in various colors. Upon returning to their body, the room appeared as a lit-up space carnival circus with glowing eyes and faces from other art pieces moving around. The alien encouraged the participant to enter a wormhole-like portal above the TV but the participant hesitated due to fear of not being able to return.

The participant's friend confirmed they would be fine if they entered the portal, though the friend appeared to have an additional eye that moved slightly before their regular eyes. The participant eventually decided against entering the portal and communicated this decision to the alien, who responded with confusion and sadness before closing its gadgets down.

As the colors in the room toned down, the participant felt a sense of encouragement from the living mural to maintain positive interactions and balance karma for future experiences."
316,100203,"The individual reported two experiences with an unknown substance, starting with 20mg. The onset was rapid, lasting about one minute. Physical effects included a heartbeat rate rush, vibration up the spine, body heaviness, and detachment. Visuals consisted of sight being pulverized into colored fragments. The experience peaked at around three minutes and lasted for six minutes before returning to baseline.

In the second experience with 45mg, physical sensations were similar but more intense. The participant reported an acquired ability to see a new dimension where they perceived an invisible clown face on their ceiling. Initially scared, they later understood it was not menacing but rather a distortion of energy flow in the fourth dimension. They also experienced becoming air entering their lungs and enjoyed the spirals and movements as an airstream. With expanded consciousness, they found it easy to adjust energy knots within their physical and ethereal bodies."
317,106194,"The participant reported feeling the room shake slightly upon initial ingestion. After a second dose, they felt life slipping away as auditory frequencies dropped until inaudible. The visual field began to dissolve into layers, then a grid-like pattern, and finally tiny fractal puzzle pieces. A pressure enclosed their vision, forcing them to lie back with closed eyes.

During this experience, the participant was propelled into another form, different from their own, accompanied by a reminiscent feeling. They revisited memories of loved ones, experiencing deep remorse for their loss while simultaneously realizing that all beings are united at their core. This led to a dissolution of barriers and a sense of being reset, akin to a fetus in a mother's womb, with feelings of warmth, contentment, and oneness.

Upon coming down from the experience, the participant felt reborn with a new perspective on life and death. They concluded that what comes after this life is a unity beyond explanation, suggesting endless possibilities for the spirit and essence of being."
318,109499,"The participant begins their journey by inhaling a substance from a dab rig and immediately experiences intense visuals and ringing sounds. They feel as if they are on a rickety space rocket traveling through various sights until reaching the peak of the experience. At this point, they see themselves in a convex mirror set against an outside scene while being in a white room. The mirror begins to shake, causing physical sensations that initially scare them but then turn into euphoria. They feel their atoms tearing apart on a subatomic level and realize they have died. This realization leads to the understanding that death is not something to fear if one has lived a happy life.

In the second experience, the participant inhales another dose of the substance from a vaporizer. After blacking out for what feels like minutes, they are transported into a kaleidoscope-like portal filled with sacred geometry and then to a beautiful sunset scene. Despite being in complete darkness afterwards, they feel an overwhelming sense of happiness and euphoria. The experience concludes with them feeling giddy and curious, surrounded by friends who have also had profound experiences."
319,106202,"The participant inhaled a substance and experienced initial physical sensations including room shaking and auditory changes. The visual perception of the environment transformed into layers, grids, and fractal-like patterns before their vision was enclosed by pressure. They entered an altered state where memories of loved ones played out vividly, accompanied by feelings of deep remorse for their loss but also a realization of oneness with others. This led to a dissolution of barriers in consciousness and a sense of being reset or reborn.

In this new state, the participant felt like a fetus in a womb, experiencing warmth, contentment, and love. They concluded that all beings are connected at an essential level. Upon returning to normal awareness, they reported feeling as if waking from a dream, with a renewed outlook on life and death. The experience left them contemplating mortality and the nature of existence beyond this life."
320,90303,"The participant began by smoking a moderate dose of an unknown substance along with marijuana, experiencing pleasant effects including humming and rushing sensations. They then increased the dosage significantly, consuming approximately 100mg of crystals mixed with marijuana in a second session. As they inhaled deeply, time seemed to collapse around them.

Closing their eyes, the participant entered a void filled only with patterns and colors, unable to find any comforting thoughts or familiar concepts such as memories or beliefs. This state was extremely intense and left them feeling disconnected from their usual sense of self. When they briefly opened their eyes, reality appeared disarrayed and confusing, with objects like hands appearing as wavy silhouettes.

The participant's friend attempted to engage them but the experience remained overwhelming. After some time, the participant managed to regain enough awareness to call out for their friend, expressing that everything felt ""blown apart."" Upon emerging from the intense state, they reflected on the spiritual nature of the experience and the dissolution of their ego."
321,94442,"The participant began by preparing a small amount of a yellow powder in an ice pipe and inhaling it deeply. Upon exhaling, they experienced immediate auditory distortion, with music transforming into chaotic beeps and entities attempting to communicate. A second smaller inhalation followed, causing physical discomfort but allowing the experience to continue.

Visual hallucinations set in rapidly, altering perceptions of the environment. The walls appeared to have a flowing water texture, while the carpet seemed to undulate like waves. These visual effects were intense and lasted for an extended period, though the exact duration is not specified.

As the experience began to wane after about 20 minutes, the participant reported feelings of optimism and hope, describing the substance as enlightening and intelligent."
322,104062,"The individual prepared their dose carefully and began the journey at 9:00 A.M., feeling emotionally distressed prior to the experience. Upon inhaling, they experienced intense visual distortions, with patterns and colors dancing in their vision. The ground beneath them felt foreign as if they were hovering over it. They then entered a state of panic and emotional distress, feeling despair and anguish.

Suddenly, without warning, they hugged themselves tightly while sitting in lotus position, crying and laughing simultaneously. This moment brought intense emotional clarity and self-love. After opening their eyes, the world appeared peaceful yet vivid and wild. The individual stood up and walked outside to bask in sunlight but remained lethargic due to the dose.

As they looked at the ground, it transformed into various shades of blue, from aquamarine to electric blue, before returning to its original gray color when they took a step. They walked around their house for fifteen minutes total, feeling internally straightened out and ready for another experience."
323,103747,"The participant and their friend smoked a substance together at around 1:30 AM. After inhaling, the participant felt waves of sensations running through their body, starting with coldness and intense visuals that made it seem like the world was continuously collapsing and reforming. The music played during the experience sounded slow and distant.

As the trip progressed, the participant's mind expanded and they felt a sense of disconnection from reality. They reached a peak where they couldn't feel anything or remember who they were. This state lasted for an unknown amount of time before the participant regained control over their body and could move again. The music still sounded distant when they came back to awareness.

After coming down, the visuals returned to normal around 1:50 AM, but the participant felt different and experienced uncontrollable shaking that was described as normal by their friend. They stayed up until about 5 AM before falling asleep easily.

In the days following the experience, the participant had frequent flashbacks and found that thinking about the trip intensified their highs when smoking cannabis."
324,92808,"The participant began their experience by consuming a powdered substance followed by sublingual DMT approximately 75 minutes later. After about 20 minutes, they felt the onset of effects and moved to a darkened room for the peak experience. The visuals were described as complex and beautiful, featuring fractal patterns that took shape as walls and tunnels.

During the trip's peak, the participant experienced out-of-body sensations in what they referred to as ""hyperspace."" They encountered dozens of humanoid entities who appeared loving and engaged with them. Additionally, there was a menacing troll-like entity representing negative feelings, which the participant chose to interact with despite its intimidating appearance. The experience took a darker turn with aggressive humanoid entities that seemed to physically attack.

The trip became highly introspective as it progressed, leading to profound thoughts about existence, consciousness, and their place in nature. The participant experienced intense ego death, visualizing their personality breaking into pieces and dispersing into the environment. They felt a sense of oneness with nature and an expansive awareness that they described as god-like.

The open-eye visuals were particularly vivid, featuring intricate machinery and humanoid entities moving around their room. These beings sometimes appeared to sit on the participant's bed. The trip lasted approximately 4.5 hours and included multiple peaks, each more intense than the last."
325,67505,"The individual began their experience in a room lit by pleasant light, with music playing in the background. After inhaling the substance through a homemade vaporizing pipe, they felt a sense of floating and an intense visual trip almost immediately. Colors morphed into intricate patterns that were vividly detailed and realistic.

As the effects intensified, the user reported feeling as though their eyes remained open even when closed, allowing them to see the room in detail with trippy colors. They then experienced a surreal journey through moments from their life, guided by visual patterns formed from the word ""GROOVED,"" which was visible on a wall.

A character appeared whom they referred to as the DMT character. This entity communicated with the user about the impact of drugs and the presence of God, showing them both positive and negative aspects of their life. The music in the background seemed to carry messages from this character, altering lyrics to convey specific meanings related to the trip.

The experience was described as scary yet transformative, leading the individual to feel a sense of salvation and hope. They reported feeling dead at one point but then experiencing a burst of happiness and renewed purpose. This encounter with the DMT character provided insights that influenced their perspective on life and drug use."
326,48050,"The individual attended an informal gathering near a river, featuring psy-trance music and various activities like juggling and fire twirling. They took a pill containing MDMA earlier in the evening and felt increasing warmth, contentment, and unity with others as it kicked in. Later, they smoked a joint that included DMT and cannabis. Upon inhaling, they experienced auditory blending into a buzzing noise, followed by visual effects of colorful strings forming a wormhole. Opening their eyes revealed the river appearing like wobbling black jelly synchronized to music.

The MDMA's peak coincided with DMT experiences, creating cycles where the individual would feel pulled back into intense visuals and sensations multiple times over 15-20 minutes. Friends recognized the state and interacted accordingly. After coming down from these effects, the person felt physically buzzing, radiating positive energy, and continued to engage in activities like dancing and drumming throughout the night.

The MDMA's comedown was minimal, leading to a peaceful sleep upon returning home around 2:30 AM."
327,105392,"The participant consumed a substance from a vial they had saved for two years. They experienced a body high after the first few hits and visual effects shortly after the third hit. Initially, they saw orange and yellow patterns that anthropomorphized into faces with eyes looking into their own. The colors shifted towards electric blue and grey, and more faces appeared, some resembling Easter Island heads glowing with blue energy.

The participant felt as if they were inside a living, breathing computer motherboard, with rapid color changes. They experienced an out-of-body experience (OBE) where they saw themselves in a sea of colors and spirits. During this OBE, faces laughed at them and told them ""Know your place, child.""

After opening their eyes, the room appeared normal, and they watched cirrus clouds turn into a Buddha shape. Normal perception gradually returned, but the participant felt that the experience was difficult to remember in detail due to its extraordinary nature."
328,111224,"The participant consumed a dose of an unknown substance extracted into tea at a friend's house before going to a park. They smoked the substance in a bong, holding it for about 25 seconds. At T+0:20 minutes, they felt very light and their vision turned red. Confusion set in around T+1 minute, with continued euphoria lasting approximately 10 minutes. Vision returned to normal by T+12 minutes, though a slight buzz remained. Around T+20 minutes, the participant experienced another dose of an unknown substance from someone they did not know well, which again caused red vision and strong euphoria."
329,105885,"The participant reported leaving their body and entering an abyss where they encountered a large golden rope with pink flaking moving upwards. At the end of this rope was a massive sphere composed of images depicting optimal outcomes for various aspects of life. These images were described as beautiful beyond words, bringing tears of joy to the participant's eyes.

The participant attempted to move closer to the sphere but experienced pain in their ribcage when trying to get too close. They noticed that the rope seemed to be attached directly to their earthly body at the chest area. When they tried again while observing their body, it arched upwards as if being pulled by the rope, indicating a physical connection.

After contemplating the implications of reaching this sphere, which would require leaving their earthly body permanently, the participant decided against it and returned to their body. Upon awakening, they immediately began crying for unknown reasons and felt that their life would never be the same due to this experience."
330,107909,"The individual began by consuming a small amount of a substance, experiencing an immediate physical buzz followed by a loud zooming noise and a sensation of time fast-forwarding. Initially feeling apprehensive, they quickly calmed down and closed their eyes to see geometric patterns in gold, red, and orange. They felt as though their body was moving through another realm, becoming one with the earth and its vibrations.

Opening their eyes, they perceived the environment differently, noticing that bushes and trees appeared to be dancing harmoniously. After a few moments of this heightened state, they consumed more of the substance, experiencing similar sensations without fear or anxiety. The experience lasted approximately 20 minutes before subsiding, leaving an afterglow. They repeated the process later in the day but found the initial magic was diminished."
331,114605,"The participant began by inhaling vaporized substance and experienced a familiar dark realm. In this realm, they found themselves strapped into a chair with three or four tall, slim, black ceramic humanoid-like beings surrounding them. Each being had a gold band around their head with an embedded red crystal in the center.

One of these beings approached the participant and poured a viscous, transparent jug of black liquid down their throat. The liquid caused intense sensations as it passed through the body, seemingly deconstructing layers of experience, memory, and emotion. This process was observed by the other beings present.

The dissolution reached pure joy, good intentions, love, and beauty, overwhelming the participant with gratitude towards the entities for this experience. It became apparent that these beings were responsible for dissolving souls after death into a liquid form to be judged.

After the process concluded, the participant returned to their living room, speechless but eager to document the experience."
332,113624,"The participant began their experience by smoking a small dose from a pink dragon rig while listening to music in a relaxed setting. They felt their body relax and saw initial visuals after about 5-8 seconds, but these were brief and lasted only around 5 minutes.

After a short break, the participant took a larger dose and experienced intense visual hallucinations characterized by fast-moving shapes, sacred geometry, and neon colors. During this period, they communicated with an entity that emphasized the importance of drinking natural water from Earth. The entity then guided them into a trance-like state where they heard soft sounds and felt a presence around them.

In one moment, the participant perceived a marble in their mouth which shattered when they tried to remove it. They experienced difficulty swallowing and received instructions from an entity to swallow the marble multiple times. This interaction was accompanied by frustration and resentment expressed through imagery of scissors at the participant's neck.

The experience concluded with strong visuals and the presence of a sugar skull entity, which had appeared in previous experiences. The participant felt a magnetic force towards this entity despite its dangerous nature. They ended their trip with music playing on TV and were able to write down some thoughts before coming back to reality."
333,110523,"The participant heard multiple voices immediately upon ingestion of an unnamed substance. These voices communicated that they were coming to the participant, indicating a sense of anticipation or preparation for what was about to occur. 

Visually, the participant saw an intricate and complex geometric structure described as a rotating pillar with a machine in its center. The pillar had walls surrounding it on all sides. With each rotation, there was a flash of energy that felt intense enough to melt the brain. This visual was described as a swirling, self-looping image similar to a psychedelic GIF but with transparent green hues and symbols covering it. A translucent square rotated at the center, emitting power and energy.

The participant experienced a sense of connection to this geometric structure, feeling both familiar and unfamiliar with its presence. They were told that this visual was a breakthrough moment and felt overwhelmed by its complexity and significance. The voices informed them that they would be a jester in their next life for experiencing this equation, which the participant found amusing.

The experience included physical sensations of movement, described as being like a jester's dance, with the consciousness or soul moving like a puppet under control. There was also an ego loss experienced during this time, which the participant found pleasant and not problematic.

Conceptually, the participant was told that their current life is a simulation among many possible universes or dimensions. They were informed that they had a body to maneuver, food to eat, and tasks to perform as part of a larger mission or experiment being conducted by unseen entities. These entities were described as scientists monitoring and teaching the soul to be perfect and enlightened.

As the experience came to an end, the participant felt overwhelming warmth, kindness, and happiness from these voices, leading them to feel reborn into their reality. The next day, they went outside and allowed the remaining substance to dissipate naturally, feeling a sense of accomplishment for having completed what they were born to do."
334,114513,"The individual began their experience by taking small doses to ease into the state. They felt a sense of freedom but were interrupted by the need for additional dosing, which caused some anxiety and fear when an entity appeared as an ominous female wasp-like being from the ceiling fan. This cycle of fear and letting go continued as they took larger hits.

Lying on their stomach to avoid the fan, the individual experienced intense fractalization and time cycling, with a strong focus on meditation techniques to achieve ego loss. They observed coded symbols in their environment and engaged in repeated cycles of letting go and returning to reality due to thoughts about the experience not matching expectations or anxiety from the ego's resistance.

The realization came that the inability to let go of oneself was the source of their anxiety, stress, and unhappiness. This insight was reinforced by recalling past meditation experiences where they viewed their body as a cloud of sensation. The individual cycled through various states for about 90 minutes before returning to normality.

Upon returning to regular activities, the person received a text message from a woman they had recently pushed away, which coincided with the timing of their experience and felt serendipitous. They called her and discussed everything, acknowledging their damaged relationship but feeling an unexplained push towards reconciliation."
335,100116,"The participant inhaled a large amount of vapor from a mixture containing an entheogenic compound and tobacco. They immediately felt their feet float away and experienced warped perceptions, with objects appearing extremely small or large. Upon lying down, they entered a dark, cocoon-like state filled with intense visuals reminiscent of the movie ""We Are The Strange.""

In this altered state, the participant encountered various entities, including familiar monsters from previous experiences and a giant snake that protected them. They also broke through two symbolic walls in their journey. The music changed to heavy metal, which shifted their experience into what they perceived as hell, where they fought and defeated a devil-like entity, becoming the ""Angel of Death.""

The trip lasted approximately 15 minutes before ending, with the participant feeling it was worth the high dosage."
336,92270,"The participant prepared for their first effective DMT experience by vaporizing a small bowl of cannabis to take the edge off. After packing DMT powder on top of partially vaporized cannabis and covering it with more cannabis, they took three hits from the vaporizer. The first hit sent them into an ineffable state where everything seemed different but incomprehensible. The second hit intensified the experience, making visuals real rather than hallucinations. The third toke fully immersed them in a vivid visual landscape.

Closing their eyes revealed a tunnel of green rectangles with shifting red and orange Aztec symbols surrounding it. Opening their eyes again, they saw their backyard transformed into an alien environment. A large evergreen tree appeared to reach out to hug them, radiating pure love and consciousness. The tree was composed of smiling faces in a fractal pattern, each face leading to another identical face with massive grins. These faces were also present on an unlit tiki torch.

The experience left the participant feeling serene and content for days afterward."
337,83514,"The participant began by smoking a mixture of cannabis and an unknown substance in a bong, resulting in immediate strong physical reactions and vivid visuals. The environment appeared to vibrate and flow, with everything covered in complex, swirling patterns resembling double helixes in bright colors. After laying down, the participant encountered multiple alien-like entities above them. These beings were described as towering figures communicating among themselves while looking down at the participant. The participant felt connected to these entities through a network of tentacles or tubes and experienced a sense of unity with them. As the experience progressed, the visuals and sensations intensified before gradually subsiding. The encounter left the participant in awe but also slightly anxious."
338,86612,"The user experienced their first encounter with an unknown substance while at a river with friends. They reported vivid hallucinations including geometric patterns and altered perceptions of reality when looking at the sky and river. Upon closing their eyes, they saw intricate designs resembling those in Alex Grey's artwork and colorful chrysanthemum visions.

On a second occasion, the user smoked the same or similar substance alone at home. This time, the experience was less pleasant, characterized by a burning sensation in the head, urgency to move around, and distorted perceptions of reality when looking in the mirror. Hallucinations were present but not as vivid as the first trip.

The third attempt occurred the next day with the addition of damiana. The user felt a chemical change in their brain, described as a DMT-induced lobotomy, and experienced shape-shifting visuals similar to LSD but less intense. They felt lost and panicky even in familiar surroundings like their backyard. After the experience, they reported confusion, lethargy, and a lingering sense of disorientation lasting for two days."
339,106805,"Upon taking a dose of the substance, the participant experienced a vivid hallucination in which they found themselves in what seemed like a carnival environment filled with animated, impossible acrobatics. Upon returning to reality, instead of melting walls or swirling hieroglyphics, their surroundings appeared normal. However, an unusual event occurred: a flap-like opening appeared on one of the surfaces in the room, through which cartoon characters stuck their heads out and made strange sounds before retracting back into another dimension.

The participant was initially stunned by this occurrence but then began to laugh hysterically as these characters reappeared multiple times, each time making the same bizarre sound. The experience concluded with the participant pacing the room and expressing amazement at what they had witnessed."
340,113630,"The individual prepared for a ritual in their sacred space, setting up an alter and lighting candles before smoking DMT. After inhaling the substance, they experienced a shift in perception where they felt as though their molecular structure was changing into a formless being. Their visual field became filled with complex geometric shapes and fractals.

During this altered state, the participant's physical body seemed to fade from consciousness while their surroundings transformed into an unfamiliar emotional dimension. They reported feeling joy and entering a new level of consciousness.

After three hits, they felt as if their eyes closed but could still see through their third eye, maintaining awareness of their physical form in the room. Their astral being then entered a colorful dimension with greens, pinks, blues, and indigos where four formless feminine beings appeared along with a central figure.

The participant asked these entities what they needed to do to improve their life. The central entity approached and inserted a key into the participant's chest, turning it three times which released an abundance of love from their heart chakra. This experience made them feel more complete and at one with everything.

The beings engaged in a dance-like motion while sharing this moment until the participant slowly returned to earthly consciousness after about 20 minutes."
341,97478,"The participant inhaled a substance through a bong that was prepared with marijuana ash. Upon exhale, they experienced blurring vision and an intense rushing sensation. They laid down on a couch with a blanket over their face and closed their eyes, leading to immediate visual hallucinations. The visuals were described as hypertextured black and white squares constantly rearranging, forming the sides of a cube. There was a sense of presence nearby.

The participant then observed thick black lines resembling twisted highways studded with white tetrahedral shapes that formed patterns similar to self-organizing nanopatterns. Vivid colors reminiscent of a 50s style diner predominated the visuals. At one point, they felt terrified and unsure if they were breathing, leading to concerns about the duration of the trip and seeking medical attention.

The intensity lessened gradually, allowing for longer coherent thoughts. The participant lifted the blanket and experienced open-eye visuals that were fluid and snakelike in motion across overlaying patterns. These visuals lingered even as the sense of time slowly returned. The entire experience lasted less than 15 minutes according to the participant's perception, though their friend estimated about 5 minutes with eyes closed."
342,108200,"The participant experienced their first encounter with an unknown substance after consuming it orally along with another substance. Initially, they felt relaxed and saw moving patterns on the ceiling similar to previous experiences with other substances. After using a vaporizer, vivid visual hallucinations began, including geometric shapes that were more impressive than expected.

A male entity appeared, described as human-like but not entirely human, followed by a female entity who seemed familiar and possibly related to the participant. The setting shifted to an operating table where the entities examined the participant's body, palpating different spots on their neck. A giant drill was seen hanging above, causing initial fear but no action was taken.

The entities communicated in musical noise-like sounds, which the participant felt they could understand telepathically. They were instructed to open their mouth a few times, and the participant complied by yawning repeatedly. The experience lasted about 30 minutes, during which the participant felt overwhelmed with thoughts and struggled to let go.

Upon returning from the trip, the participant felt extremely happy, light, and soft, with a strong ball of energy in the center of their chest."
343,81894,"The participant began the day at a music festival, where they consumed hash food and later four hits of LSD. As dusk approached, they smoked an unknown substance with a friend. After inhaling the smoke, the individual experienced a buzzing sound in their left ear and felt as if they had risen out of their body. They saw warm colors like reds, oranges, and yellows before moving towards a dark space that resembled a black hole. Two figures appeared: one described as an oval with a digital voice and another more circular figure speaking naturally. These figures asked the participant if they could see something. The individual felt disconnected from reality and experienced a moment of pure nothingness or self-collapse, followed by a return to awareness where everything seemed new and fresh."
344,106226,"The participant consumed a substance along with Syrian rue seeds about an hour prior to smoking DMT. After dosing, they experienced a gradual increase in intensity as they smoked more of the substance. Visuals began forming behind closed eyelids, initially appearing as geometric patterns within a room that stretched and expanded.

As the experience progressed, the participant was enveloped by flower petals and encountered a dragon-like entity described as preparing them for something. They then traveled through hyperspace, seeing various images including Simpson characters and their own split-open head with four quadrants. The journey led to a place created by language where chanting occurred, and they were greeted by two entities: one menacing and the other comforting.

The menacing entity communicated in an understood but unfamiliar language, expressing that the participant had wanted this experience very much. The comforting entity assured the participant's welcome there. Fearing breaking some universal law, the participant was placed in a correctional vehicle with alarms sounding, signaling their soul to return to its body.

Upon opening their eyes, the participant felt scared but relieved to be returning from the intense experience."
345,99502,"The individual begins their journey in what they refer to as the 'waiting room', described as one-dimensional, steel-colored, and uncomfortable due to its mechanical feel. After this initial phase, they experience a breakthrough into another realm where they encounter a massive red orb. This orb is glowing and radiating a strong life force.

In this new environment, the participant feels watched by unseen entities. For the first time in their experiences, one of these entities communicates with them, instructing them to ""eat it."" The orb then appears on a spoon, and despite its large size, it smoothly enters the participant's body, filling every part as it descends into their stomach.

The entity informs the participant that they may keep this orb forever. Upon returning from the experience, which felt very brief, the individual feels a subtle warmth and heaviness inside them. They remain still for an extended period, crying when their partner checks on them. The participant can still feel the warm red glow of the orb even after the experience concludes."
346,88924,"The individual began by attempting a DMT experience but did not achieve breakthrough effects. They then decided to try Salvia, starting with 50 mg. During this first dose, they experienced mild euphoria and visual distortions, including their field of vision splitting into two regions. The second dose was 40 mg, which led to more pronounced effects: the world appeared cleaved into three identical versions, forming a kaleidoscope-like view. The participant felt as though they were part of the couch they were sitting on during this experience.

While under the influence, the individual communicated with their friend, repeatedly expressing that the experience was interesting and weird. As the effects wore off, one field of vision became dominant again, and the participant's coordination was impaired."
347,104085,"The participant began by consuming an amphetamine, which was followed by inhaling DMT from a bowl. The DMT experience was intense and unexpected due to the participant's low tolerance for amphetamines. Visual hallucinations were vivid and geometric, with patterns described as fractals of triangles. Initially, the participant observed their friend Peter's beard transforming into these intricate designs but then chose to focus on closed-eye visuals.

The participant experienced a blend of intensity and relaxation during the high. They reported feeling euphoric and free from negative thoughts while their consciousness seemed to expand into cosmic realms. Despite this altered state, they remained aware of their surroundings and could hear conversations in the room clearly. When asked by Peter where the plates were, the participant responded accurately, which amused others who assumed the participant had fully broken through into a deeper psychedelic experience.

The DMT high lasted approximately 10 minutes for the participant, though it felt longer due to the nature of the trip."
348,104148,"The participant and their girlfriend were in an apartment room when they prepared for the trip by packing a glass bowl with ash and the substance. The participant took two hits, holding each for about 12 seconds. After the second hit, colors became more intense, and the participant felt extremely happy, crying tears of joy. They saw their girlfriend as having orangish skin with six eyes running up and down her face and a green aura. The participant then blacked out and experienced something they could not remember after coming to."
349,101445,"The participant took an unknown substance in a single hit from a bong setup. They immediately felt extremely high, describing it as more intense than previous experiences with mushrooms and LSD. Upon exhaling, they were immersed in a psychedelic state characterized by rapid and deep visuals. Wood surfaces appeared to be crawling intensely.

The experience was so overwhelming that the participant had to put their head in their lap at one point. They perceived the room's dimensions as expanded and felt like they were inhabiting a space between life and death. Even with eyes closed, the visuals were intense and unavoidable. The participant did not encounter any entities but could see how someone might feel that way.

The trip lasted approximately 7 minutes but felt much longer due to its intensity. Upon coming down, the participant felt relieved and grateful for returning to a normal state of consciousness."
350,112899,"The participant consumed three doses of an unspecified substance and experienced vivid visual hallucinations characterized by intricate fractal patterns in swirling colors, including orange, lime green, red, and black. These visuals created an immersive environment described as a ""room of cosmic Elder Gods."" The participant reflected deeply on various aspects of their life, including childhood, adolescence, relationships, work, family, traumas, failures, and successes. They felt overwhelmed by the realization that human existence is transient and compared it to playing a game.

As the experience began to wane, the participant interacted with a dog that licked their hand, expressing gratitude towards the animal. The participant then conversed with a friend about the intensity of the experience, describing feeling ""squashed"" or as if they had fallen into a volcano."
351,98631,"The participant began by smoking a small amount of a crystalline substance from a glass pipe. Immediately after inhaling, they noticed the smoke behaving unusually, forming a white ball that floated around the room before exploding into vivid colors and images. The user found themselves in what felt like another universe, surrounded by planets and celestial bodies.

These celestial objects merged into a human-like figure that rapidly multiplied into various sizes and shapes. The figures approached the participant, some morphing into animals, including their pet dog. One of these entities had eight arms and numerous tattoos on its body with swirling symbols. It gestured for the user to stand but then jerked its hand away, screaming ""We are not for you!""

The participant felt themselves sinking into a dark hole, pursued by the figure which now had wings. The entity drew a circle in the air and urged the user to enter it, causing them to feel their body morphing. They heard many voices calling out their name.

Suddenly, the figure flew past, saying something like ""It's time for you to return to nocturnal, my child."" The participant then felt themselves falling back into their house and re-entering their physical body on the bed. Upon returning to reality, they found their friend watching them, who had also taken a hit of the substance."
352,98672,"The participant and their friend attended a small rave in California woods. They obtained 0.3 grams of MDMA each and snorted half of it before dancing. After about an hour, the other person gave the participant two hits of LSD. The combination intensified sensory experiences, making music and visuals more vivid.

At around two hours into the experience, they encountered a third individual who had DMT and invited them to share it. They smoked enough for two sessions each. During the first session, the participant felt detached from their body, experiencing a white-out state with intense sensory overload. Upon returning to consciousness, there was a sense of confusion but also calmness.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling the effects of LSD and some residual MDMA, though details about the rest of the night were not provided as they were deemed less relevant for this report."
353,105167,"The participant experienced an intense rush shortly after consuming the substance. They lay down on a bathroom rug and covered their eyes with a towel, which intensified auditory and visual perceptions. The sound of a fan in the room became dramatically altered, to the point where it was unrecognizable. 

Visual hallucinations followed, featuring clover-shaped tunnels with cross-sections of different colors. The participant felt a strong euphoria and almost giggled but managed to suppress it. Removing the towel revealed an alien-like appearance of the room: lights were brighter and colors paler than usual; objects appeared distorted in size and shape, some flowing or waving while others moved back and forth.

The participant then observed their own body from above and found it unrecognizable, which was initially scary but did not dampen their happiness. Pupils were noted to be extremely dilated when looking in the mirror, with facial distortion also apparent. The entire experience lasted approximately five minutes."
354,112734,"The participant took a substance and experienced strong effects after about two hours. They felt nauseous and vomited red puke before lying down in their room with earphones playing psytrance music. During the peak experience, they saw a blue figure that they later identified as possibly Vishnu or Shiva. As the visuals declined, the focus shifted to internal realization, leading to an ego death state where they felt detached from their mind and experienced everything as interconnected without opposites like good/bad or life/death. This state lasted for about four hours until the ego slowly returned."
355,102539,"The participant visited a close friend's bedroom where they consumed a small dose of a psychoactive substance. After inhaling deeply from a glass pipe, the effects were felt immediately. The experience was described as beautiful and calming, with intense feelings of pleasure and ecstasy. The participant reported feeling light, warm, and experiencing an overwhelming surge of love towards their friend. They did not report any hallucinations but remained in a state of intense emotional and physical sensation for several minutes before slowly returning to reality."
356,87046,"The participant inhaled a dose of DMT and immediately experienced visual distortions, with black rips appearing across surfaces and fractals cascading into their vision. These visuals were accompanied by morphing images associated with previous trips, such as purple oil slicks and sixties busses, which dissolved to give way to a new reality pulsating with altered music.

The participant felt the need to expel something unnatural from their body through coughing and dry heaving. They then saw a repeating pattern of a pipe and box, indicating an out-of-body experience where they could see from multiple angles simultaneously. The world was described as infinitely complex, made up of geometric patterns and shapes that constantly shifted.

During this state, the participant felt disconnected from their physical surroundings but deeply connected to the new reality. Time seemed both infinite and insignificant. As the effects wore off, the room reformed, and the experience faded into a vivid dream-like memory."
357,96585,"The participant had previously used various substances many times and considered themselves experienced with altered states of consciousness. After attending a gathering where others were using a substance, they decided to try it at home late at night. They prepared a large dose and began their experience while lying on a bed in their basement.

Almost immediately after inhaling the substance, the participant felt an intense sensation that overwhelmed them. Their perception became fragmented, with different parts of their mind seemingly handling various bodily functions simultaneously. This was accompanied by vivid imagery and sounds, including what they described as self-transforming entities pointing and laughing at them. The experience was initially nightmarish and overwhelming.

After a period of intense activity, the participant's consciousness began to stabilize. They felt trepidation and regret for their initial vanity in attempting a large dose. Gradually, the experience became more benevolent, allowing them to process their emotions and come to terms with aspects of death. Upon returning to normal awareness, they noticed that their pants had changed appearance due to physical reactions during the trip.

The participant reflected on the profound impact this experience had on their outlook, including overcoming chronic panic attacks and developing a sense of acceptance regarding death."
358,60186,"The participant experienced vivid visual effects after inhaling a larger dose of the substance. Initially, the wall across from them appeared to have trickling rain-like patterns that transformed into red diamond shapes covering the entire surface. The wall then began to pulsate and move in wave-like motions. Throughout the experience, the user heard their heart beating slowly and intensely.

The participant's mind remained relatively clear despite the intense visual alterations. They attempted to interact with objects in the room but found it difficult to perform actions such as reading a clock or putting away their pipe. No entities were encountered during this trip.

The experience lasted approximately 10 minutes, during which time the user felt unable to move and observed various changes in their surroundings."
359,95512,"The participant and their friend were in a room with dim lighting and music playing when they smoked 40mg of DMT mixed with cannabis. The author took multiple hits from a pipe, experiencing visual distortions after the second hit. By the fourth hit, they saw a portal that appeared vaginal-like with warm red surroundings and a god-like white center. They felt intense closed-eye visuals and faces appearing and reappearing at high speeds.

The participant then found themselves in what seemed like another room, possibly belonging to someone of great power. Their body appeared as an endless black void, leaving only their mind intact. The friend also appeared lifeless. The author experienced a sense of being dead but remembered smoking DMT and calmed down slightly. They felt the experience lasted for eternity despite it actually lasting 10 minutes.

During this time, they encountered entities or beings that seemed to punish them for not respecting the substance. These entities were angry and threw intense visuals at the participant violently."
360,90873,"The participant experienced a strong psychedelic effect after inhaling vapor from a pipe containing an unspecified substance. Initially, they felt a warm sensation spreading up their body. Their vision became distorted with bright colors and rainbows appearing throughout the experience. Objects in the room began to take on new forms; for example, a cushion transformed into a rainbow-colored porcupine leaving a trail behind it. People and objects developed multiple eyes and mouths, which was described as strange. The curtains moved violently, and the flower pattern on them formed a face with a large mouth that slowly opened and closed.

The participant asked how long the experience would last, to which they were told approximately 20 minutes. After about five to eight minutes, the intense effects began to subside, but colors remained distorted and everything continued to wobble for another ten minutes or so. The overall duration of the trip was around 25 minutes."
361,86757,"The participant experienced a rapid onset of intense visuals and auditory effects after inhaling the substance. Initially, they saw geometric patterns that grew larger and more complex. As the experience progressed, the room appeared to stretch into another dimension filled with white and orange 2D shapes with soft edges and bright light.

During this phase, the participant felt as though their heart had stopped beating and they were in a state of euphoria, believing they belonged there. They then perceived their boyfriend's body as rubbery and morphing, sometimes appearing like buildings or made of bright colors that moved and changed. The room continued to change, with objects morphing and reappearing in different places.

The floor transformed into a shiny gold surface with red patterns resembling Indian temples/buildings. The participant felt an intense euphoria while observing the energy and vibration of everything around them."
362,111542,"The participant began floating in a sky blue space and encountered a large green arrow pointing to a molecular structure. This led them into a flow chart depicting organic life processes on Earth, visualized as computer graphics. They then found themselves in a control room resembling Houston Mission Control, staffed by fairy-like nurses wearing nurse outfits with white paper hats. These entities communicated with the participant, expressing authority and instructing them to return to their ""simulation."" The participant responded by declaring clearance for high-level access and requesting to speak to the person in charge. They were then guided back towards Earth, perceived as a house on a green hill, before regaining normal consciousness."
363,104219,"The participant and a friend prepared DMT for inhalation using a makeshift smoking device made from a plastic bottle and aluminum foil. They took two doses. During the first dose, the participant experienced paralysis and encountered non-verbal communicating spirits who showed them an experience resembling death. The second dose was more intense; the spirits criticized the participant's thoughts as selfish and unworthy of deeper insight, indicating that the participant needed to become ""pure enough"" to see the ""Spirit Mother."""
364,83368,"The participant felt nervous before the experience and smoked two bowls of cannabis with friends prior to inhaling a substance. Upon inhalation, he experienced rapid movement sensations and visual distortions such as ancient faces on rocks. He heard machine-like sounds and saw spinning red hieroglyphics and stone statue faces that changed from frowning to smiling when he altered them in his mind. The participant also perceived beings emerging from rock crevices but noted they would go still if looked at directly."
365,112299,"During the experience, the individual noticed enhanced visual details such as colors appearing softer and textures more pronounced. The participant felt detached from their body, particularly noticing that their hands seemed luminous and their legs moved autonomously. There was a heightened sense of consciousness, almost as if it could be experienced as a physical sensation.

The person reported an increased ability to perceive the emotions and mind-states of others, described as sensing their aura. This included feeling the depression of one individual and the frustration of another without being emotionally affected themselves. The experience lasted approximately 40 minutes, during which time they drank a bottle of beer, potentially enhancing some effects.

The participant felt calm, peaceful, and upbeat throughout the trip. They also noted a shift in their feelings towards their grandmother, feeling eager to become more independent rather than remaining under her nurturing but controlling influence."
366,85363,"The participant experienced a sudden onset of warmth throughout their body followed by auditory sensations that seemed like gibberish but were understood. They encountered beings made of energy who communicated through a shiny gold medium and created physical objects from singing or talking in unfamiliar languages. The participant felt normal mentally despite the bizarre occurrences.

These entities taught the participant to create an indescribable object, which they did by expelling energy from their mouth. Upon creation, the beings applauded and congratulated them on understanding something others had failed to grasp. During this experience, the participant lacked memory of their real life and felt like a different person.

The visions then shifted to geometric colors and shapes in high definition. A figure made of gas and energy appeared, reaching out with tentacles-like appendages to touch the participant's head. The figure massaged the participant's head while conveying complex information that was difficult to comprehend. The experience concluded with the participant feeling nearly sober."
367,112150,"The participant began their experience by smoking a mixture containing an unknown substance along with marijuana in Billy's bathroom. After several inhalations, they experienced heightened sensory perception and visual distortions, including geometric patterns resembling rainbow armadillo scales. The world appeared hyper-realistic yet somehow artificial.

As the trip progressed, the participant was asked deep personal questions which seemed to be a test of their responses. Upon providing satisfactory answers, they were shown 4D representations of various universes within what felt like a hyperverse. They then reported this experience to Alex and took another dose.

In the second phase, the participant flew through a red and white tunnel past a barrier, encountering new universes. An entity with a crystalline, upside-down almond-shaped head appeared on their right side. The entity gave the participant a box containing a multi-dimensional hypersphere that felt like it was pulling them in. The entity laughed an extra-dimensional laugh, which the participant joined.

The entity introduced itself as the participant's ""little nephew,"" despite the participant not having any siblings or a nephew. When asked about their family, the entity showed the participant what appeared to be an apartment complex-like structure with grids of terresects outlined in white, one emitting a golden brown aura. The participant attempted to navigate this multidimensional space but got lost and eventually left through another side.

The experience concluded with a period of kaleidoscopic afterglow lasting approximately 20 minutes."
368,76376,"The participant inhaled a substance and experienced an intense psychedelic journey. Initially, they saw a dark figure spinning and making a humming sound. This was followed by flashing lights of various colors swirling around them. They then felt as if they were falling into the depths of their mind, hearing wind sounds but unable to perceive any part of their body. When attempting to speak, only low, unintelligible echoes returned. A push on their back guided them back towards consciousness, where they gradually regained clarity and could see objects in their room more clearly. Upon returning to physical awareness, the participant felt peaceful and satiated."
369,80708,"The participant experienced a psychedelic episode after smoking an unknown substance. Initially, they felt only a slight body load but then inhaled a larger dose, leading to intense physical sensations including vibrations throughout their body. Visual patterns appeared in the periphery when eyes were open and became more vivid upon closing them. The visuals included bright green and yellow patterns that seemed intricate and moving rapidly. The participant was overwhelmed with emotion during this experience, which lasted approximately two minutes. After the episode ended, they felt disoriented and laughed at the colorful, moving carpet."
370,81391,"The individual began by smoking a significant amount of a substance, experiencing rapid onset effects characterized by visual patterns and intense sensations. Lying on the couch, they encountered a singular entity that appeared female and communicated comfortingly with them. This entity showed the participant smaller beings emerging from its body, orbiting around what felt like a gravitational mass in their stomach.

The experience was described as transposing onto existing perceptions, blending with reality while maintaining an awareness of time passing normally despite altered perception of speed. The entity explained that these overwhelming sensations would persist but become more manageable over repeated experiences.

In a subsequent session, the participant encountered numerous small entities in a bustling environment, further validating their existence and showing them additional phenomena."
371,90510,"The narrator and a friend begin their trip in a car, experiencing visual distortions typical of acid use. They move to a bluff where the narrator takes an initial hit from a pipe containing another substance. As the effects set in, they see a machine-like entity that disintegrates reality before being replaced by Buddha, who meditates silently. The experience is described as deeply humbling and transformative. After the peak of this experience, the individual perceives entities trying to burst through everyday objects into the collective reality. Trees are seen with alien faces whispering messages."
372,110218,"The participant had four experiences involving a substance. In the first two sessions, they reported enhanced perception of beauty in nature, slowed time, and a feeling of connection with the environment. The third session was described as deeply healing, where the participant felt unconditional love from angelic entities that permeated everything around them, including objects and their own body. This experience led to profound insights about themselves and others, dissolving previous judgments and fostering an overwhelming sense of gratitude and acceptance.

The fourth session began with a larger dose, leading to intense visual patterns and a feeling of being in a psychedelic hell realm characterized by fear and confusion. The participant experienced synesthesia and difficulty functioning normally. There were thoughts of ending the experience through extreme means but eventually found relief outside. Upon returning indoors, they felt gratitude for reality and learned about balance between altered states and everyday life."
373,52552,"The narrator attended a concert where they consumed marijuana brownies and joints before the show. About 45 minutes into the concert, the effects of the brownies kicked in. The narrator then smoked another joint and encountered an older man who offered them a hit from a glass pipe. Unaware that it was not marijuana but DMT, the narrator took a hit and experienced intense visual and auditory hallucinations. After about 25 minutes, the narrator woke up on the floor near the loading dock, surrounded by friends."
374,76662,"The participant began their journey with a high dose of an unknown substance, which was administered through inhalation. Initially, there were no significant effects, but after consuming more of the substance, the individual experienced intense visual distortions. They perceived themselves as having eight arms and felt disconnected from their surroundings, unable to recognize their friends. Their vision became extremely blurry and then completely white, with occasional faces appearing through the whiteness.

The participant reported a complete loss of sensory perception, leading to physical reactions such as tensing up and shaking due to fear. They sat up startled at one point but then laid back down, observing shifting patterns on the ceiling that resembled an ocean. Upon coming out of the experience, they felt happy and euphoric without any lingering fear."
375,45347,"The participant experienced three distinct trips after consuming an unknown substance. In the first trip, they felt a buzzing sensation as they inhaled and then entered a tunnel of light. The center of this tunnel contained a ball of light from which Celtic patterns emerged, forming the walls of the tunnel. These patterns appeared to represent souls or lives of people. As the participant moved through these patterns, they suddenly returned to their physical surroundings.

In the second trip, after taking another dose, the participant was surrounded by changing colored lights and felt their soul merging into a pool of light. They experienced moments of pure light followed by sensations of life, such as wanting to live and simple pleasures like having tea or feeling the sun on their skin. Upon opening their eyes, they were initially scared but then encountered an organic digital pattern that touched them near the liver area, inducing a profound sense of calm.

The third trip occurred while meditating by the sea with an amethyst crystal. The participant saw intricate pentacle patterns and felt connected to a goddess, experiencing synchronized breathing with the waves."
376,84850,"The individual began the experience in a natural setting with a companion. After ingesting the substance, they felt every particle in their body charged and experienced tunnel vision initially. Closing their eyes led to abstract visualizations resembling paintings being washed away. Opening their eyes again expanded their field of vision significantly. The companion's face morphed into an alien-like cat with unusual features.

Closing their eyes once more revealed patterns and shapes changing constantly, predominantly gold and red in color, before turning black. There was a sensation of being pulled out the top of one's head while remaining physically still. After this, all senses merged into one singular experience, creating a profound sense of connection to everything around them. The experience concluded with the individual feeling clear-minded and calm."
377,76713,"The individual was introduced to a substance by three unexpected visitors at a friend's house after drinking alcohol. Upon inhaling the substance, they experienced an intense trip characterized by a warm buzzing sensation and euphoria. They reported mild visual hallucinations, including everything appearing with a yellow glow and transforming into hexagonal shapes. The eyes of one visitor were noted as large, glowing yellow, resembling those of a bug. The effects lasted approximately 15 minutes, followed by residual euphoria for about an hour."
378,78594,"The participant was alone in their room with no light or sound. After smoking, they experienced difficulty performing the act due to altered perception. Visual distortions began after several inhalations, with brightly lit rooms appearing to pour out of the pipe. The bubbler ended up on the floor five feet away from them. For about five minutes, the participant felt disconnected from spacetime reality, seeing boxes and spinning geometric shapes. They could feel their back against the wall but when they tried to look behind themselves, their perspective would spin around. As the experience progressed, the participant became worried about remaining in an altered state of consciousness. They reminded themselves that the substance was safe to use. After a few minutes lying in bed feeling wacky, the participant decided to go online and make an experience report which helped them feel better."
379,111493,"The participant smoked a substance that included DMT during the day while alone in their room. After inhaling three times, they experienced an intense trip characterized by fear and disorientation. Their bedroom transformed into a bright, circus-like environment with a sinister aspect. The participant felt as though they were being pulled upwards out of themselves.

A being communicated with the participant, telling them it was ""time to go"" and that they needed to prepare to leave this world behind. This being described the current experience as a temporary funhouse or cosmic waiting room for their next destination. The participant expressed fear about proceeding further but also an interest in attempting a breakthrough dose under different conditions."
380,98311,"The participant began their experience with feelings of nervousness and fear as they prepared for what was described as an intense encounter. Upon inhaling, the environment around them dissolved in a manner that felt both alien and overwhelming. The participant reported feeling detached from themselves and observed their body decomposing while the universe spun rapidly.

As the experience progressed, the participant encountered a positive presence that acted as a guide, helping them regain their sense of self. This led to an intense sensation described as a full-body orgasm followed by elation. Upon returning to their physical form, the participant expressed gratitude and laughed uncontrollably. They then observed overlapping layers of energy in the universe with a grin that seemed to transcend normal human expression.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling unshackled and free, suggesting an altered perception of reality and a newfound sense of joy and understanding."
381,97612,"The participant consumed a very high dose of an unknown substance in a weed pipe under a bed of marijuana, leading to immediate visual distortions and melting away of their room. A silhouette of a man appeared briefly before the participant entered a state of complete nothingness. In this state, they were visited by an African American 'pimp' looking figure who guided them through what seemed like white space or a world with geometrical hallucinations such as hexagons, triangles, and spheres moving around.

After falling asleep, the participant returned to their friend's house where they consumed smaller doses of the substance. The first dose was 50 mg and had little effect. The second dose was 40 mg and resulted in a strong out-of-body experience. The third dose was 70 mg and lasted longer but did not break through.

The participant felt extremely positive after their initial high-dose experience but later became detached from social interactions, finding conversations with friends and family boring and aggravating."
382,65124,"The participant began the experience while sitting in a room after smoking a substance. They immediately felt disoriented and drifted into a daze. In their altered state, they found themselves standing in a desert with clear thoughts about their purpose there. Despite not moving physically, the environment around them shifted as if it were moving through the desert.

The participant then entered a cave where they encountered writing on the walls that frightened them. As they progressed further into the tunnel, they experienced nested hallucinations and saw creatures emerging from the walls. Upon reaching an open chamber, they met an entity resembling themselves sitting on a throne. The entity was asked questions by the participant but only responded to one question about dying, stating that there were more things for the participant to do before their end.

The experience concluded with the participant weeping and then waking up on the floor of their room."
383,90691,"The individual began by smoking crystals of an unknown substance, which caused rapid visual patterns followed by the appearance of light-based gnome-like creatures in their field of vision. These gnomes communicated in English, addressing personal concerns such as job loss or future worries, concluding with the phrase ""That doesn't matter."" They also repeated ""You're closer"" before disappearing.

During this experience, the participant opened their eyes and saw a friend standing in the room, surrounded by a tunnel of colored fractals shaped like the friend's silhouette. The room was filled with vibrant patterns, and the Indian mandala tapestry appeared to spin.

Closing their eyes again, dark-colored imp-like creatures resembling a xenomorph alien from 'Alien' crossed with a monster from 'Pan's Labyrinth', with long spider-like fingers, danced around in the participant's vision. These imps repeated ""You're closer"" and laughed when asked what it meant, dancing faster each time.

The experience concluded with the individual going outside to watch the sunset and observe their garage morphing."
384,73476,"The participant begins by reflecting on their current state of low toxicity due to previous use of substances like DMT, mushrooms, and LSD. After a long day at work, they engage in browsing pornography online, feeling disconnected from emotions despite experiencing guilt over having a girlfriend. They masturbate and then vaporize high-quality DMT. During the DMT experience, they feel their mind being cleansed and have visions of cosmic imagery, including a thousand-petaled lotus and multi-lens telescopes. The participant also mentions spiritual references such as YHVH, Kali, Shiva, and the Kwisatz Haderach."
385,71527,"The narrator and three friends were at an apartment when a mutual friend arrived with a substance. After researching online, they decided to use it through a chillum pipe. One by one, each person inhaled the substance. The first individual experienced immediate visual hallucinations, smiling and gazing at non-existent objects.

When the narrator took their turn, they felt intense colors and sounds, followed by uncontrollable laughter. They reported seeing stars and rapid changes in color backgrounds. Their body felt heavy, as if they had swallowed a large amount of codeine. The faces of others appeared to melt inward and outward for an extended period.

After about ten minutes, the narrator began to come down from the experience, noticing colors flashing less frequently and faces remaining stable. By thirteen minutes, everything returned to normal, and the narrator felt relieved, grabbing their laptop and lifting it in the air.

The other two friends also experienced similar effects during their turns. The overall atmosphere was described as being on a different planet with constantly changing, living objects."
386,68151,"The narrator and their friend Jordan smoked a substance in a glass pipe after consuming alcohol and cocaine earlier in the evening. The narrator went first, taking multiple tokes until they felt intense visual hallucinations and passed out on the bed. They experienced vivid colors that intensified with each thought and described feeling like they were in a divine sexual encounter.

Jordan then took his turn, moaning in ecstasy but not talking much about his experience. The narrator had several experiences over 1-2 hours. In one instance, an elf-like entity greeted them and tried to show them something mysterious before the trip ended abruptly. Another time, towards the end of their experience, they heard a strange entity repeatedly yelling ""hey"" or ""yoy.""

The narrator felt satisfied with the overall experience despite not fully investigating what the elf wanted to show them. They spent an hour discussing the trip with Jordan afterward."
387,84361,"The individual consumed an unknown substance multiple times, leading to vivid visual hallucinations and physical discomfort. After observing others ""breakthrough,"" they decided to do so themselves using a homemade smoking device. Upon inhaling, they began coughing and experienced nausea, vomiting into a garbage can provided by someone in the room. During this process, their vomit appeared as animated snakes writhing in front of them. They also perceived a poster melting off the walls and encountered an intimidating figure with distorted eyes who seemed displeased with their presence. The participant felt extremely scared and believed they were dying. As the experience progressed, the room appeared to expand significantly, and they experienced a sense of stress despite having no apparent reason for it. Upon coming down from the trip, they reflected on the profound impact of the experience on their perception of life and spirituality."
388,72656,"The individual experienced an intense visual and auditory hallucination after administering a dose of an unknown substance. The room appeared transformed into a green/blue space with futuristic furniture, and the usual clutter was no longer visible. Voices were heard echoing in the room but could not be seen or responded to directly. A being described as large, square, and colorful was encountered next to the individual, who then disintegrated and sank away. The person felt panic and believed they had died, imagining their parents crying and friends running out of the room in a frenzy. They also perceived another friend as ""god"" telling them everything would be alright. After about 10 minutes, which seemed much longer due to the intensity of the experience, the individual regained most senses and realized that what they saw was an effect of the substance rather than reality."
389,74019,"The participant attempted to ingest the substance three times before achieving significant effects on the third attempt. Initially, there were no notable effects from the first two doses. However, during the successful dose, the participant experienced vivid visual hallucinations and altered perception of reality. The experience began with tunnel vision filled with bright shards of fall colors and intricate patterns, causing a sensation similar to motion sickness that subsided as the experience progressed.

The participant then found themselves in an environment featuring a South American pyramid. A hieroglyphic woman appeared in 2D form near the pyramid. She opened her mouth, and instead of words, paisley-like vines flowed forth and wrapped around the participant, framing their visions. The woman held something in her hand that she seemed to want the participant to take.

The experience lasted approximately six or seven minutes before reality began to set back in as the sun rose behind the pyramid. Upon returning to awareness, the participant could see the forest again and was aware of the campfire and sounds around them. After the journey, the participant felt euphoric for about an hour and spent time discussing their experience with a friend who also had a similar journey."
390,109814,"The participant began their experience in a bedroom setting after smoking a substance through a water pipe containing cannabis ash and crystals. After inhaling three times, they experienced increasing physical sensations including pressure in the ears and tightness in the body. Mental effects included flashing images and ideas, as well as a split vision or mind sensation. Opening their eyes revealed an alien yet recognizable environment. They felt inhabited by a spirit within their body but did not feel powerful despite this realization. The intense effects lasted about 5 minutes with lingering psychedelic aftereffects for another 10 minutes. Two hours later, the participant reported remaining alertness in the mind."
391,64836,"The experienced individual smoked 40 mg of an unknown substance. Upon inhalation, intense visual hallucinations emerged, featuring numerous mechanical plant-like entities that grew rapidly around them. These entities touched the user physically, causing a sensation of being grabbed and pulled constantly. The participant felt scared and wished for the experience to end quickly. The trip lasted approximately 7 minutes but was extremely intense due to the unexpected strength of the dose. The setting was not ideal as the individual was in a hurry and feeling disappointed, though they had sedatives to help calm themselves."
392,98647,"The participant took a high dose and sat down to experience it. Within 5 minutes, they were on the couch; by 10 minutes, the carpet appeared to move, and by 15 minutes, everything seemed to shift like on a living ocean. The visuals were vivid enough that the participant had difficulty distinguishing them from reality.

The participant reported feeling various sensations represented visually: someone beating their body like bongos, a storm cloud raining on their shoulder, the sun warming their body with a shining glow, and a woman kissing their neck softly. These sensations were not painful but rather full of love, joy, and happiness.

During introspection, questions would be immediately answered logically. The participant experienced synesthesia, perceiving music in wavelike motion similar to visuals. Lights flickered rapidly yet slowly from bright to less bright. Time perception was altered, with the experience lasting about 15 minutes.

The participant felt a tug of the universe and Great Consciousness but did not fully detach from their body."
393,80806,"The participant prepared for the experience through meditation and previous trips, setting up a comfortable environment with candles and pillows. They inhaled an extracted substance and experienced intense kaleidoscopic visuals with eyes appearing within them. The visuals then shifted to a white forest-like world filled with tree-like figures. In this world, they encountered a woman made of bathroom tiles who told them that fear is just a state of mind and ambition is more powerful. After the encounter, their vision went black before returning to normal. Since the experience, the participant feels as though they know the answer to everything and uses the lesson about fear being a state of mind when feeling fearful."
394,81905,"The participant inhaled an unspecified substance multiple times, experiencing intense visual hallucinations including rotating geometric patterns and hieroglyphs that seemed to convey ancient knowledge. They perceived a divine being composed of complex, multidimensional structures. The experience lasted approximately five minutes before they returned to reality, feeling compelled to exclaim ""their people!"" and warning others about the potential dangers of improper use."
395,62326,"The participant describes multiple sessions of substance use over several months, culminating in a unique experience during their fourth session. After consuming the substance four times, the individual reports entering a transformed reality where everything appeared gold and colorful. They were able to visualize how objects functioned internally. The experience then shifted from visual to emotional, with a strong sense of an alien presence observing them. This presence was described as having been there all along but only noticed during this session.

The participant felt the alien presence was a divine force that provided profound insights into human existence, almost like solving a mathematical proof for life's meaning. The experience left the individual speechless and unable to process it immediately afterward. It took about three days before they could reflect on what had happened. They acknowledge that while the experience might be attributed to chemical reactions in their brain, it felt significant enough to impact their perception of reality profoundly."
396,111450,"The participant experienced an intense drug trip characterized by vivid geometric patterns in red, orange, and yellow colors. They encountered a large face-like entity that was present but not fully visible or communicative. The environment felt alien and mechanical yet living. As the effects subsided, they saw strange bluish cities before opening their eyes and expressing amazement at the experience."
397,84797,"The participant inhaled a psychedelic substance through a pipe, experiencing immediate sensory changes. Vision became pixilated and bent on multiple axes, colors appeared more luminous, and the environment seemed animated. The user's girlfriend held their hand during this experience. When lights were turned off and music played, intricate geometric visual hallucinations emerged that synchronized with the rhythm of the music. These visuals included layered, saturated colors that superimposed and crowded each other. The participant felt a range of emotions including fear, love, comedy, anger, and elation. A black hole-like entity briefly engulfed them before releasing. After about 4-5 minutes, the user returned to normal consciousness but remained speechless for some time due to the intensity of the experience."
398,41039,"During the experience, the participant observed numerous colorful figures, predominantly female, which approached and seemed to touch their face. These figures had grotesque faces and swayed left to right. The participant then transitioned into a vision of a rainforest filled with gems and crystaline butterflies. They felt as though they could feel moonlight on them in this setting. The experience was brief."
399,110829,"The participant began their experience with small doses of the substance, gradually increasing the dosage as they became more comfortable. They sat cross-legged in front of an aloe vera plant and observed it closely. Initially, the plant appeared translucent and vibrant, with visible fingerprints and intricate details such as cell structures and microscopic rivers of activity within its fronds.

The participant then noticed a spider on one of the fronds. The spider was described as having translucent legs and hyper-real features. As the participant focused more intensely on the spider, they felt an overwhelming sense of empathy towards it, almost seeing through its perspective. However, when they took a larger dose to further examine the spider, the plant began to morph and wave uncontrollably.

This led to a state where the participant felt like an animal, reacting instinctively without human thought. They experienced a sensation of being under attack by a vast, cosmic presence, which they likened to the ""eye of the universe."" This feeling caused panic and a retreat from the plant until it subsided. The experience concluded with the participant reflecting on their heightened connection to nature and empathy for living beings."
400,89657,"The individual began experiencing light-headedness and nausea after taking their first dose. They noted linear visuals where everything appeared straightened out, such as grain patterns becoming pinstripes and objects aligning in a uniform manner. After additional doses, the room started moving and changing appearance, resembling a cartoon. The participant felt disoriented and questioned whether they were still in their own room. Objects like books and furniture floated around in geometric patterns, and their belongings appeared distorted. They mentioned that their pipe turned into a jello-like substance."
401,111083,"The participant reported feeling their consciousness detach from their physical form while sitting by a river. They experienced vivid imagery from their past, with scenes flashing into their mind. The environment appeared unfamiliar and had a 1950s film grain effect. The participant felt as though they were in the body of an elderly woman in a retirement home, where staff fed them pudding.

In this setting, the participant encountered a figure wearing black robes who slowly turned to face them. This entity was described as having yellowed, rotting hands and a skeletal face with maggots on its side. When the entity placed its hand near the participant's face, they experienced rapid visions or memories that did not seem to belong to them.

The experience lasted approximately 15 minutes but felt much longer."
402,104574,"The individual began their experience after consuming Ketamine and listening to music. They then inhaled DMT through a pipe while meditating. Visual hallucinations of colorful patterns appeared initially. The participant reported feeling a deep spiritual connection, which led to an introspective moment about personal health and lifestyle choices. The substance communicated the need for physical and mental purification before deeper experiences could be achieved. Following this trip, the individual made significant changes to their lifestyle, including quitting smoking and engaging in regular exercise and meditation."
403,108873,"A new user experienced an unusual auditory effect following the consumption of a substance prepared from acacia rootbark. After inhaling approximately 20mg through a bowlpipe, they heard a flashbang noise in their ears that gradually subsided into a continuous but low-volume sound. This permanent auditory sensation has persisted since 2014 and is described as similar to the sound of a flashbang at volume level 1 on a scale from 1 to 10. The user reports hearing this sound every day upon waking, which they find unsettling and distracting, though it does not seem to significantly impair their daily functioning."
404,31038,"The individual consumed two pills of ecstasy at around 20:00 and later smoked an unidentified substance with a friend. Upon inhaling, they experienced a colorful image and an electronic sound, along with the sensation of being surrounded by a liquid-like energy field. After 'awakening' from this state, they made a baby-like sound that appeared as a golden substance to them and their friend. This sound was perceived as joyful and caused their friend to laugh uncontrollably. The experience concluded with feelings of joy and emotional emptiness."
405,60278,"The participant smoked a substance and entered an altered state where they perceived a self-folding forest with alien trees and canopy that were gnarled and unsettling but not terrifying. They heard entities communicating ""happy... happy... HAPPY little elves!!!"", which conveyed the message that the experience was not to be taken lightly.

Later, while lying in bed, the participant saw a wall lamp transformed into a hideous corpse head with putrid white skin stretched over its bony face, causing them to vomit slightly. The vision disappeared after some time. During the night, the participant's flatmate entered their room and took something from their desk, which they later questioned about but received an inconsistent response."
406,26157,"The participant and a companion backpacked into a Rocky Mountain wilderness area for a week of camping and fishing, bringing an unidentified substance extracted using the Quantum Tantra Technique. They used this substance each night after dark by placing small amounts in a glass pipe connected to a water pipe. The smoke was harsh but manageable with the use of the water pipe.

On the first night, staring at a picture of Isis, the participant experienced patterned light that morphed into a vision of Isis in green and black, with complex light flowing from her hands for about a minute before fading back to patterned light. They felt elated afterwards.

The second night, while staring at a Huichol peyote yarn painting, they saw animated children holding hands and singing along the edges of their vision, followed by a flashback of an earlier mushroom vision dominated by Mexican motifs. The third attempt that night involved staring at an ancient Egyptian calendar, resulting in patterned light with reds, blacks, and oranges flowing three-dimensionally over them. After about a minute, they saw a sun shining through a stone-carved window and floated up into a room where Nuit stood raising her arm towards the sun, feeling as if being initiated to a different level before returning to patterned light.

Another attempt involved listening to Buddhist music while under the influence, causing the patterned light to flow rhythmically with the music. The participant found this experience beautiful and almost alive.

On another night, staring at a Hebrew letter Aleph, the companion experienced an unusual cloud formation that took the shape of the letter before dissipating, leading them to decide against further experiments using Hebrew letters.

The final night, while staring at a picture of Tara, the participant saw intense patterned light with intricate designs and complexities. They gripped their knees as they sat on the ground, trying to stabilize the cascading intensity of the vision. After about 6-7 minutes, they focused on a circular design that morphed into an eye with a grinning mouth below it before returning to normal.

After each experience, the participant felt good and returned to a normal state of mind within a few minutes or after sitting for a while if still woozy."
407,24299,"The individual began their experience in a tent at dusk, feeling an immediate onset of effects after inhaling smoke from a crude pipe-like device. They experienced a rapid implosion of their physical body to the size of an atom, followed by visual patterns and colors that intensified as they moved through what felt like a tunnel or wormhole. Upon opening their eyes, everything appeared in bright, dancing energy forms, with objects not appearing solid but rather composed of vibrant, moving shapes.

The participant walked around, observing the environment with amazement, noting that even mundane items like cars were transformed into dazzling displays of color and light. They approached a field where people were gathered and noticed the stage was not anchored to its surroundings; it moved in response to their gestures. After about 15 minutes, they returned to the tent to find one friend still there while others had gone for walks.

The experience left them feeling amazed at what they perceived as an expanded reality and a demonstration of human potential. They described the overall effect as similar to a steady mushroom trip but with unique elements of amazement and discovery."
408,24260,"The participant experienced a rapid onset of effects following inhalation of DMT. They felt a tingling sensation starting from the spine that traveled to the forehead, accompanied by colorful butterflies in their vision. The participant perceived themselves leaving their body and entering a multidimensional space filled with golden salamanders, various undefined beings, animals, flowers, trees, jewels, and crystals. These entities communicated the secrets of life through music described as harp-strings and choirs.

Physically, the participant fainted immediately after inhaling DMT, lying motionless for approximately 7 to 10 minutes while their friends attempted to revive them by shaking and shouting. Upon regaining consciousness, the participant experienced a return to normality with minor physical discomfort including headaches and ear buzzing."
409,14823,"The individual began their experience with a sense of fear that something might have gone wrong, followed by an overwhelming feeling of power as the substance took effect. Early visions included infantile environments and a garbage bin filled with rotting filth inhabited by friendly living beings. The participant then experienced a progression from infancy to adolescence, perceived from a higher perspective.

Visions included scenes resembling ancient times, such as docks in an ancient harbor with muscular sailors, and otherworldly landscapes featuring molten metal structures that resembled strange flowers. There were also experiences of soaring through archetypal natural forms, like deep sea pods of creatures resembling whales or dolphins.

The participant encountered a barrier protected by what they perceived to be a demon, resulting in intense vomiting. Afterward, the experience returned to one of peace and beauty with reduced physical discomfort. The individual felt reassured about their place in a divine order and recognized themselves as part of a spiritual hierarchy where each person is a child of God.

The trip concluded after approximately 7 hours, leaving the participant with a sense that they had been given everything needed to understand their life up to that point. They experienced headaches during recovery but found them bearable due to the profound impact of the experience. The following nights included dreams in which the individual was someone else with a different name and body."
410,12058,"The participant was alone in a quiet redwood forest at 2 pm when they consumed an unknown substance. After lying down and looking at the trees, they perceived them as vibrant crystal jewels with enhanced depth perception. The branches appeared to sway gently in a breeze that eventually stopped but left some branches still moving. The participant felt a deep connection to the forest, sensing its unity and joy. They experienced the trees as playful, aware beings existing in an ancient, timeless state of bliss."
411,116409,"The participant experienced vivid visual hallucinations featuring Aztec and Mayan symbolism. They perceived a Mexican man who narrated their experience, speaking in English and describing himself as being inside their head. This narrator explained that he would guide the entities working on the participant. The participant felt an intense flow of energy directed at them, which they interpreted as healing or cleansing.

Towards the end of the experience, translucent orb-like beings appeared, described as water drop-shaped with kaleidoscope details inside. These orbs seemed to be part of the final stages of the experience before it faded. Upon regaining awareness, the participant felt a sense of relief and gratitude for the encounter."
412,108514,"The participant began their journey by inhaling vaporized powder into a bong filled with fresh water. After exhaling the hit, they experienced an immediate shift in perception: the room turned gray, time seemed to stop, and reality became static. The only color visible was from blue Christmas lights hanging above the mantle.

Closing their eyes, the participant saw geometric patterns and vivid blue visuals that transformed into a mist-like energy. This energy danced and spun around them in an unfamiliar black space, moving trans-dimensionally for what felt like an extended period. Opening their eyes again, they noticed the blue lights pulsating as if they were neurons or distant galaxies.

The walls of the room began to crack and dissolve into pixels before falling away like shattered glass. The participant found themselves floating in a void, observing stars that glistened with crystal white light. They then experienced being propelled forward at high speed through space, eventually arriving at an enormous city filled with spectacular beings.

These multi-headed entities communicated telepathically, imparting knowledge and certainty to the participant. After this encounter, the experience faded into blankness. Upon regaining consciousness, the participant felt a profound connection to their friends and expressed gratitude for hearing human voices again.

The trip left the participant questioning the nature of reality and existence, leading them to ponder concepts such as infinite loops of life and the possibility of tapping into vast energy sources without drugs."
413,115703,"The narrator interacts with multiple entities who mock them initially but become friendly over time. The entities assess the narrator's energy and potential, calling them ""flawless"" and suggesting they could be a ""god"" or psychic. They are transported to an area lit by golden light where beautiful human-like figures resembling ancient Greek/Roman gods are present. These figures discuss the narrator and their past actions. Next, the narrator is brought to a city square where a man with ""alpha male"" energy cooks something over a fire and welcomes them to his kingdom. Upon opening their eyes, numerous spirits are seen partying in the room before leaving as the experience concludes."
414,115761,"The participant entered an alternate realm after thorough physical and mental preparation. They encountered three tall beings who displayed little interest in their presence. These beings were positioned around a central entity, which was a human foetus. The realm appeared more real and clear than our own world. Filled with a sense of unworthiness, the participant did not attempt to look at the faces of the tall beings but noted their imposing presence. After observing the scene, the participant exited the realm with humility, feeling honored by what they had witnessed. Upon returning, they were consumed by thoughts about the possible significance of this encounter and its connection to a potential pregnancy of their daughter."
415,115586,"The participant took a small dose of a substance before bed and experienced an intense trip. They were greeted by a group of entities who communicated with them telepathically. These entities informed the participant that the music playing was not being produced by them. The leader of these entities showed and told the participant things, which they found welcoming and pleasant.

The experience then shifted to a scene where the participant saw a half-animal, half-man figure pushing a shopping trolley, dancing, and wearing a dress near an iron gate. This scene was perceived as humorous by the participant. Upon returning to reality, the participant felt energized and excited but could not recall all details of the experience.

The trip lasted for a short duration, and upon regaining consciousness, the participant noted that thoughts about another substance were no longer present in their mind."
416,115567,"The participant experienced entering an infinitely dense, viscous underlying energy realm filled with infinite independent entities upon taking a dose. These entities were welcoming and communicated verbally, saying ""Oh! Welcome hoooooooome! So glad you escaped the ape perspective again!"" The participant asked to learn something from them, and they responded by offering to synchronize consciousnesses. This involved receiving beams of light containing information directly into the mind, creating a physical pressure in the head during the process. However, the experience ended before the ""upload"" was complete."
417,69732,"The individual smoked what they thought was marijuana but turned out to be DMT at a friend's house. They experienced intense sensations and visual effects shortly after smoking, including heightened perception of colors and surroundings. The group left the house and walked through a park where they encountered three cops searching through a bag. The individual then led the group to a market in a small neighborhood. On their way, a woman accused one of their friends as a runaway and said the police were coming. A cop arrived, questioned them, and handcuffed the girl identified as a runaway."
418,110090,"The participant began their experience by sitting but soon felt a sensation of being controlled and calibrated, allowing movement similar to Michael Jackson's dance mixed with Tai Chi. A Serpent Goddess named ShCallie entered them, though they were not a good match. Later, another entity called SShura joined, forming a better connection.

During the trips, SShura used specific physical actions such as breathing techniques and hand movements. In one instance, the participant was in an operating room-like setting with a reptilian nurse. An elephant-like humanoid God then entered them, followed by a machine-like God. The experience included memories of their parents from childhood and感受到了SShura的存在。

随后，参与者进入了一个房间，在那里他们看到了一个类似阿米巴的棕色物体，带有触手，并被一团彩虹状的云包围。这个场景似乎代表了物质世界和纯净领域之间的对比。SShura再次加入后询问参与者是否想摧毁“神”，但参与者表示不想摧毁它，而是希望与之沟通。

在经历了一系列复杂的体验后，参与者准备返回现实世界。他们进行了肌肉锻炼、吞咽测试等动作来检查身体功能的恢复情况，并最终结束了这次旅程。"
419,106802,"The participant had multiple intense experiences after inhaling a substance. In one experience, colors became brighter and patterns appeared over a video, making characters look like 2D paintings. Another encounter involved seeing a being made of black and red rods in what resembled a subway tunnel; energy from the being caused physical sensations that led to nausea. The participant felt a realization about everything existing within them and experienced disorientation.

In another experience, they found themselves in an organic-looking room with blue walls, where a motherly creature resembling Chewbacca but with woolly mammoth-like hair greeted them as if waking up from sleep. A subsequent experience involved intricate patterns on the computer screen that extended beyond it, along with glowing objects in the room and a sense of being in a detailed, inviting reality.

The participant also reflected on the nature of reality, questioning whether their experiences were literal or metaphorical, and pondered how to integrate these insights into everyday life."
420,103033,"The participant took a dose of a psychedelic substance and then inhaled nitrous oxide to enhance the effects. Upon inhaling the substance, they experienced vivid colors and fractal patterns inside the car, which appeared infinitely large. The car's interior took on an amazing sheen with intricate designs. They saw their friend in the back seat with four rotating heads and could not recall what another friend looked like.

After a few minutes, the initial intense visuals subsided but they continued to experience massive hallucinations including patterns and liquid edges. They then inhaled nitrous oxide again, intensifying these hallucinations for about 15 more minutes. The participant's friend took a dose of the psychedelic substance from them and became extremely terrified, reporting that the participant looked like an umpalompa and saw a Willy Wonka scene behind them.

The next day, after taking LSD, the participant vaped another dose of the psychedelic substance along with nitrous oxide again, experiencing flowing patterns and a robot-like appearance to everything."
421,92566,"The participant begins by inhaling an unknown substance and immediately finds themselves walking along a path surrounded by robed figures who are all looking down. An eye with a spinning pupil appears before them, growing larger until it engulfs the participant. Upon passing through this eye, they enter a massive dome containing an extensive cityscape that blends various architectural styles from different eras, covered in a brown fog.

In the center of this city is another large eye, which opens to reveal a colossal creature with glowing blue arms and a cubic head emitting structured rainbow lighting. The creature extends its arm towards the ceiling, causing a golden droplet (referred to as an ""Ark"") to fall into its hand. This droplet transforms into a flower with a heart-shaped bulb.

The participant then finds themselves in front of a stained glass window depicting black plant life waving in a pinkish-yellow ocean above which strange fish-like creatures float. Two faceless white beings sit across from the participant at a green table, speaking in unison to recommend accepting something (likely another substance) for further teachings."
422,100276,"The participant began their experience in a prepared setting, smoking two large doses and meditating. Upon closing their eyes, they found themselves in a computer-like room with walls made of multicolored energy beams. An entity appeared, composed of the same energy lines that formed the room's structure. This entity was humanoid and female in appearance.

The entity then caused objects around the altar to move violently, as if they were weightless pieces of fabric being whipped by wind. The experience concluded quickly after this interaction."
423,104233,"The participant began their experience in a calm room illuminated by a television. After inhaling the substance, they immediately felt intense visual effects characterized by vivid colors and a sense of disconnection from their surroundings. They perceived their bones, blood vessels, and nerve endings as hollow, with unusual light emanating from behind their scalp.

During this period, the participant reflected on concepts such as existence, art, time, and historical figures. The visual and sensory intensity gradually diminished after about 15 minutes, though it felt much longer to them."
424,56938,"The experience began with the inhalation of crystals from a pipe. The individual reported feeling static electricity in their mouth and throughout their body shortly after inhaling. They then entered an altered state where they perceived themselves sailing over a dark plane before encountering a colorful, patterned wall. Upon passing through this wall, they found themselves in a room adorned with similar patterns on the walls, floor, ceiling, and objects.

In this room, the participant noticed a face about 4 inches from their nose, which had large eyes reminiscent of a fly's head. The being did not use language but showed the individual a transparent model of the human body, highlighting intricate networks of nerves and blood vessels. A particular part of the brain, likely the pineal gland, was highlighted in pale yellow, matching the color of the crystals inhaled earlier.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling themselves returning to their physical body as the visual elements dissolved into wispy smoke from a pipe."
425,80863,"The participant smoked a substance that induced intense visuals and altered states of consciousness. Initially, they felt as if lifting off the ground and moving rapidly through space. A dome of energy appeared in front of them, pushing forward continuously. Approximately three to four minutes into the experience, a new visual plane opened up, revealing a demonic reptilian entity with all-knowing characteristics. This entity seemed to be guiding the participant through an unfamiliar universe.

After the trip ended, the participant experienced a full-body stoned feeling and was in an excellent mood. They spent time reflecting on their experience and attempting to explain it to friends."
426,89645,"The participant and their friend smoked a substance from a mushroom bowl, likely containing DMT, along with cigarette ash. They experienced intense physical sensations including cold sweats and fever, leading to the removal of clothing by both individuals. The friend exhibited erratic behavior such as ripping out the TV cord and expressing fear of death, stating they were about to die. Both participants felt energy around them and a sense of being outside their bodies during the experience. They supported each other through the trip, with one participant repeating ""just give it 5 minutes"" to reassure both themselves and their friend. The intense sensations lasted approximately two minutes but took thirty minutes to write about due to altered perception of time. After the experience, they felt grateful for being alive and enjoyed a meal and drink afterwards."
427,93474,"The participant experienced a powerful trip characterized by intense visual and auditory sensations. Initially, they reported seeing a white cross that shrunk into a single point before fading away, accompanied by an extended sound similar to a drop of water falling into a still pond. This was followed by a state described as ""eternity,"" where the sense of self dissolved, replaced by a feeling of being part of something larger and beautiful.

Upon returning to their physical body, they noticed that their hands appeared impossibly scaled or furry, with shifting shades of green and an ability to cut paths of light through the air when moved quickly. The participant felt as though their consciousness had been transported far away and then returned, leading to a sense of rediscovery in everyday life.

The experience left them feeling disconnected from ordinary reality but also filled with wonder at the beauty of life. They described a renewed appreciation for simple pleasures like eating breakfast and interacting with others, while still feeling somewhat alienated from their physical body and earthly surroundings."
428,92083,"The individual began the day at a friend's house in a positive mindset despite feeling slightly hungover from previous alcohol consumption. Around 10:30 A.M., they consumed some beers and listened to music with their friend M. At around 11:00 A.M., another friend S arrived with MDMA powder, which was distributed among the group. The participant, along with two others, insufflated their doses while one person took theirs orally.

About 30 minutes after consuming the substance, the individual experienced a rapid onset of effects characterized by sweating palms and an intense experience. They smoked marijuana and cigarettes during this period. Around this time, S mentioned another substance that lasted only 10-15 minutes, which was confirmed to be DMT. The participant purchased about 30 mg of DMT and inhaled it through a pipe.

The taste of the DMT was described as burning rubber, plastic, and possibly gunpowder. After inhaling the substance, the individual experienced vivid visual effects where colors began to swap places on objects in the room. For example, areas that were red turned green and vice versa. The participant also noted long tracers and people talking without moving their mouths.

The experience peaked around 11:50 A.M., lasting approximately 10-15 minutes before coming down."
429,110020,"The day began with the consumption of an unspecified substance at noon, leading to noticeable effects around 1:30 PM, including moving wood grain patterns and spontaneous colors. By 2:00 PM, the peak was reached, though the intensity was lower than expected due to a lighter dose. The experience peaked and gradually declined by 7:00 PM.

At this point, another substance was consumed through smoking, leading to an intense trip starting with three hits. The individual found themselves on a floating crystal stage in space, surrounded by lights and colors. They perceived the song ""Thunderstruck"" as part of their environment, playing lead guitar while an audience of infinite crystalline stages watched. Upon the end of the song, they woke up from the experience.

The trip lasted until around 12:00 AM when the individual went to sleep immediately. The next day, there was no significant aftereffect from the first substance but a feeling of wakefulness and energy without a hangover."
430,86868,"The participant and friends went into the woods to make a fire and consume a substance through an improvised pipe. The initial attempts were unsuccessful, but after an hour of persistence, the fire was lit. They then consumed some joints and beer before attempting the substance again. This time, the effects were more pronounced, leading to intense visual hallucinations. The participant saw burning coals transform into the face of a divine female figure with colorful hair resembling fireworks. This entity provided a sense of universal kindness, relaxation, and euphoria, alleviating fears and anxieties. After about 10 minutes, the experience subsided smoothly, leaving the participant very relaxed."
431,78454,"The participant began the experience by smoking an unknown substance with cannabis. Upon closing their eyes, they saw white light rising within their inner vision, which they associated with a Kundalini serpent reaching from and back into their body. The light then filled their entire body and took the form of a meditating being behind them. They perceived darkness at the boundaries of this vision.

During the experience, the participant lost complete sense of their physical body and could shift consciousness into surrounding objects. Their environment appeared as a colorful field of energy that they could spin around themselves. As the effects came up and down, everything had a crystal-like appearance and seemed alien. The participant heard indescribable sounds resembling beeping and perceived symbols pouring out of their mouth in waves of colorful energy."
432,107417,"The participant reported feeling at peace with life and death after the experience. They experienced reduced anxiety and uncontrollable smiling and laughing during the trip. The individual felt they could direct their own experience, choosing to focus on spiritual intentions rather than visual effects. Upon breaking through into the altered state, the person described leaving their physical body and experiencing existence as past, present, and future selves simultaneously. Post-trip, the participant reported a reset in senses and increased awareness of emotions around them."
433,73701,"On a Sunday night at college, the participant met up with a friend who had recently smoked DMT. They decided to try it together in the dorm room. As the experience began, the participant reported seeing vivid colors even with closed eyes. A female figure appeared but was not clearly identifiable. The participant felt an awareness of energy around them and described a sensation of being in a breathing hallway that resembled an esophagus.

The friend who provided the DMT was perceived as a ghost-like entity wearing a hat, with a menacing grin. Two people holding hands were briefly visualized, followed by multiple characters whose details are not fully recalled. The participant noted a pleasant body high that made them feel less stressed during the experience."
434,66707,"The participant experienced a strong psychedelic effect after inhaling smoke from a pipe. The room transformed rapidly before their eyes, folding into itself in an intense visual display of patterns and fractals. In a darkened room with candles and incense, the visuals were equally vivid whether the participant's eyes were open or closed.

A Native American figure was present throughout the experience without speaking. This figure appeared increasingly abstract as the trip progressed. The participant also saw their own body clearly, observing energy pulsating through their arteries in an extremely dissociative state.

Physical movement was challenging during this time, with sitting being more manageable than attempting to walk. The experience concluded suddenly but gently, leaving the participant with philosophical thoughts similar to those experienced after LSD use."
435,45889,"Upon arriving at his friend's house after drinking heavily the previous night, the participant was encouraged to try an unknown substance. He sat in a grassy backyard while someone lit a cone filled with the substance for him to inhale fully. Immediately after inhalation, he felt intense physical sensations and visual distortions.

The leaves on trees above him began spinning rapidly, and the trees grew very quickly within seconds, covering most of the yard. Voices around him became an alien-like language that was still understandable. The air turned into visible smoke, and his body felt like it was on fire with a dramatic increase in blood pressure.

His friend ran across his field of view, leaving a 10-meter visual trail of her body. Closing his eyes intensified the experience; he felt pulled out of his body into another dimension, seeing black with streaks of light, resembling a tunnel or cable of information. This phase was frightening and lasted about 45-60 minutes (actual duration around 10 minutes).

As the effects began to wane, voices returned to English, and visuals became less intense but still present. The participant felt an overwhelming sense of peace and bliss for about five minutes before regaining his composure. After approximately 20 minutes, he interacted with friends who had also experienced the substance earlier that day, feeling a unique connection.

The experience left him in awe and unable to fully describe its impact, emphasizing its intensity and unpredictability."
436,106661,"The participant reported feeling their body lift up immediately after inhaling a substance. They experienced geometric patterns on everything they saw, including circles. Visual distortions made objects appear both far away and close at the same time. Closing their eyes did not stop the hallucinations; instead, it intensified them. The room took on a simplistic form reminiscent of a Chinese friend's room. When standing up, they observed a mango tree that appeared like a lava lamp due to the movement of its leaves, which formed cross shapes and resembled bubbles in a lava lamp.

As the experience progressed, the participant felt as if time was passing both quickly and slowly simultaneously. They imagined their life passing by and worried about being stuck in this state forever. The hallucinations were so strong that it was difficult for them to stay calm. When coming down from the experience, everything appeared distorted and moved slowly."
437,91678,"The participant began the experience after consuming alcohol and cannabis with a friend. Upon inhaling the substance, they felt an immediate shift in perception. Visuals transformed into small, flipping cubes, and the environment appeared fragmented. They saw an elderly woman's face that morphed into three faces. The participant then experienced auditory hallucinations of their mother calling out to them in various tones. These voices seemed to come from a distant location despite knowing their mother was not present.

The experience included a sense of disorientation, with objects like water appearing broken and the hallway seeming extremely long. After approximately five minutes, the participant ""woke up"" from the trip, feeling amazed by the intensity and brevity of the experience."
438,88797,"The participant inhaled a substance and experienced intense effects that included visual disturbances such as silver flushes over their vision. They felt a sense of despair initially but then consumed some marijuana, which alleviated the discomfort. Walking into the desert, they encountered a shadowy entity called Ink Blot, approximately 5 feet tall, formed from shadows pooling on the cracked ground. The entity communicated with the participant about various topics and guided them to a source of music where they danced. The experience lasted between 20 minutes and an hour, during which time the participant felt disconnected but not entirely removed from reality."
439,68819,"The participant underwent an intense experience characterized by vivid hallucinations featuring morphing shapes with various motions including circular, linear, and flapping patterns. These visuals were accompanied by altered states of thinking that ranged from psychosis to ecstasy, alternating in waves until reaching a peak of euphoric ego loss. This was followed by a shower of euphoria, gradual ego return, and soft pastel unconscious imagery. The entire experience lasted approximately five minutes.

The participant reported a strong sensation of merging with the hallucinations, feeling disconnected from reality during this period. Negative aspects included the short duration of the effects and potential for prolonged unpleasant states such as psychosis or catatonia. Additionally, there were mentions of possible HPPD (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder) and auditory hallucinations lasting a day or two after heavy use.

The participant felt that the experience was transformative, potentially beneficial in treating addiction by providing a peak state of consciousness that could help diminish substance abuse tendencies."
440,113906,"The experience began with gradual visual effects before two entities appeared, referred to as ""tricksters."" These tricksters showed the participant two rooms: a green one and a blue one, both described as existing in an unfathomable or fourth-dimensional space. The rooms contained unknown objects. The participant felt wonderment and joy during this phase.

The tricksters then took away the participant's consciousness, causing panic, distorted thoughts, and a state of pure existence without thought or emotion. This lasted for what felt like an eternity. Upon returning the participant's consciousness, they bid farewell and returned them to their original world. The participant erupted into uncontrollable laughter upon regaining awareness in their room."
441,113771,"The narrator reports visual distortions where the walls appear to have shifting geometric patterns that resemble tree bark carvings and faces. These patterns transform into small people camouflaged on their friends' faces. The narrator experiences a sensation of sinking deeply into themselves while also feeling pulled outwards, as if made of rubber. They feel extremely relaxed and imagine being in a tropical setting with warrior tribe music playing.

The narrator sees an owl-like figure on one wall during the experience. When coming down from the trip, they step outside and feel joy looking at the sunset sky and nearby greenery. After the experience ends, the narrator feels renewed and rejuvenated, as if returning to their ""self"" before birth."
442,102211,"The participant experienced a room illuminated by a black light, where colors emerged from various crevices. Their eyelids displayed kaleidoscopic patterns of indescribable motion. Breathing felt like cold winds through dark caves with echoing reverb off metallic walls. The red blanket appeared to ripple and pump like veins, casting shadows that formed an archaic smile.

Sitting on the edge of the blanket, their hair melted like gelatin ice sickles, blending with sweat, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Breathing became a continuous process without distinction between inhale and exhale, leading to a sense of constant living.

Opening their eyes again, they noticed textures separating from surfaces, such as wood grain detaching from brown metallic squares. Clothes on the floor seemed to have bodies but no visible occupants; one was flattened by an unseen tread mark. Carpet hairs melted into serpent skin-like material that pulsed like blood underfoot. Touching felt euphoric, described as a waterfall of slimy sandpaper.

The participant's skin glowed blue through magical symbols covering their body. Closing their eyes again, they reflected on the familiar yet strange reality around them."
443,106309,"The participant had three experiences. In the first, they used a homemade 'Machine Pipe' which resulted in visual distortions: paint splatters on the floor appeared as ritualistic patterns and dots, while their hamper transformed into an alien plant. The second experience involved lying down and looking at the ceiling, which was covered in intricate patterns but did not lead to a full breakthrough. In the third experience, alone after their friend left, they had a profound vision where every moment of their life, including future scenes, passed by repeatedly. They felt helpless as if vomiting, though no actual vomiting occurred."
444,83217,"The participant had previous experience with marijuana and ecstasy before this event. They attended a party where they consumed gel tabs, ecstasy (E), DMT, and cannabis. The night began with the consumption of gel tabs, after which the effects were felt, including visual distortions enhanced by lights and a projector showing moving amoebas on the wall.

Later in the evening, the participant took ecstasy, which intensified their experience, making them feel happier and enhancing the visuals further. Approximately 30 minutes to an hour after consuming ecstasy, they used DMT by inhaling second-hand smoke from others' hits. This led to a vivid hallucinatory experience where they felt as though they were flying through corridors and flipping, slipping, and sliding through space.

The night concluded with the participant smoking cannabis, which eventually caused them to fall asleep. The overall experience was described as enjoyable, and the participant expressed interest in repeating similar activities in the future."
445,98533,"The participant prepared for the experience by watching a documentary about the 'Spirit Molecule'. They smoked cannabis mixed with the substance through a bong. Upon inhalation, visual effects began immediately. The individual saw fractal patterns of various shapes and colors that pulsed and spun to the beat of the music playing in the background. As the song slowed down, they found themselves in an infinite space with television screens displaying childhood memories. They turned off the screens showing bad memories. When the music's tempo increased again, the participant felt as if they were floating above their room, able to observe everything from a higher vantage point. The experience concluded when the song ended."
446,95714,"The participant consumed a substance mixed with marijuana through a homemade pipe. They experienced an immediate tingling sensation throughout their body after inhaling deeply. Visual hallucinations included two portals: one showing Earth in intricate detail and the other representing control over the entire universe. The participant also reported creating a new color during this experience. After approximately 20 minutes, they came down from the peak of the trip but continued to feel stoned for several hours afterward."
447,86731,"The individual experienced an intense altered state after ingesting a substance for the second time within a few hours. They reported entering what felt like an alternate reality where their perception of the world was significantly altered. In this state, they saw friends morph into abstract shapes and colors with unimaginable visual definition. The environment around them transformed into a colorful, fractal-filled background as they began to merge with others present, feeling a sense of unity. They heard voices that provided reassurance, telling them ""you're going to be okay."" Upon coming down from the experience, which took about 35 minutes, they felt as though they had nearly died and required convincing otherwise. The account also mentions perceiving those around them during the trip as deceitful with smooth, snake-like skin."
448,112487,"The participant consumed a substance referred to as the ""sacred mushroom"" multiple times, leading to emotional and mind-expanding journeys that enriched their life. The mushrooms were believed to remove mental barriers and open up access to an ""energy matrix."" On one occasion, the participant smoked another substance over two hours, experiencing small black molecule-like entities that vibrated and changed shape into disc-like forms. These discs produced a magical sound when vibrating in unison, described as having three notes with short breaks between them.

In a subsequent session, the participant consumed a large dose of the ""sacred mushroom"" before smoking the other substance again. This combination allowed for an extended experience where moments of intense strangeness were interspersed with pauses, enabling better digestion and assimilation of the experience."
449,65656,"The individual took an unidentified hallucinogen with their girlfriend in a car at a dead-end location. Upon inhaling the substance, they experienced auditory effects such as buzzing noises and echoes within their head. Visual distortions included their girlfriend's legs appearing the same length as her arms, morphing body parts on both the girlfriend and friend, colorful patterns on faces, and shifting landscapes outside the car window. The user reported feeling intense heat and sweating during the experience. They also perceived energy flowing from a cold air machine and saw a rock wall transform into a giant praying mantis. Additionally, they felt sensations of spirits or souls moving in and out of their body. As the effects wore off, reality gradually returned, leaving them feeling loopy and as if many doors had been opened in their mind."
450,95932,"The participant experienced intense visual hallucinations shortly after ingesting the substance. The visuals included colorful geometric shapes such as triangles forming pinwheels and spirals that revolved around them. They felt detached from their surroundings while immersed in an alternate reality filled with impossible forms. The experience was enhanced by a friend who also participated.

Upon returning to normal consciousness, the room appeared altered, with objects having a blue-ish hue similar to animated Tim Burton movies. The participant expressed both enjoyment and fear during the experience and intended to repeat it in the future."
451,87124,"The participant inhaled a substance and experienced intense visuals characterized by rapidly multiplying geometric patterns that changed colors. These patterns were observed on plants and other objects around them. The individual felt a powerful body vibration that increased as the experience progressed, reaching a peak where they could not determine how long it would last or its direction.

During this time, everything appeared to be covered in intricate geometric designs. As the visuals began to subside, the participant noticed that while the plants looked normal, they still seemed more beautiful and geometrically complex than before. The experience lasted approximately 10 minutes, after which the individual felt a strong afterglow and an overwhelming sense of renewal.

The physical effects included a racing heart rate and residual body vibrations. They reported feeling energized, free from guilt or shame, and connected to a universal energy field."
452,87672,"The participant experienced an intense psychedelic episode after inhaling a substance. Initially, they felt their senses diminish and were thrust into a rapid loop of life experiences that seemed to occur in quick succession. This was accompanied by physical shaking and difficulty moving. They stepped outside during the stormy weather while still experiencing these effects.

Outside, the user continued to feel disoriented with visual distortions similar to a kaleidoscope. The experience gradually calmed down after about 15 minutes. On the way home in the car, they felt extremely happy and clear-headed, though there were fluctuations between happiness and sadness during the trip."
453,97457,"The participant began by consuming an unknown substance outdoors with friends. Initially, they felt a mild effect similar to smoking cannabis or spice. After several hits, the effects intensified and became noticeable. The individual experienced distortions in perception, feeling connected to objects around them such as trees and furniture. These perceptual changes lasted about three minutes. Following the experience, the participant reported feeling that their mind was more open and motivated."
454,56062,"The participant smoked dried leaves from their jade plant. Initially, they experienced visual patterns resembling an 'Indian' blanket as well as auditory buzzing. They felt discomfort associated with self-referential thoughts during the experience. To overcome this, they opened their eyes, reached their arms into the air, flexed every muscle in their body, and howled. This action allowed them to break free from the bonds of discomfort, leading to a state of wholeness and contentment. The visual elements included layered fractals that synchronized in spinning patterns, as well as a tunnel, white light, and an Indian figure seated cross-legged."
455,72788,"The participant experienced vivid visual distortions after inhaling a substance through a modified shooter device. Initially, the room appeared to swirl with colors that changed dynamically: yellow, dark red, green, then back to yellow in waves. The participant's jeans appeared tie-dyed and moving, while arm hairs under black light turned white with a green aura. A 3D picture in the room seemed more pronounced during the experience but was later perceived as less three-dimensional upon sober reflection.

The visual effects lasted approximately 5-10 minutes before fading. The participant felt relatively sober throughout, describing it as wearing ""really cool glasses"" with a slight body buzz."
456,102886,"The participant began their first psychedelic experience in a small room with orange and yellow striped walls at 7:30 p.m., listening to Grateful Dead music while inhaling a substance through a straw. They took six consecutive hits, with assistance for the last one due to the onset of effects. Vision blurred as the walls above the television began to spin together, merging into one color. Time perception was lost, and they felt their mind in another realm while their body seemed to be shot through a tube into an unknown space. The experience lasted approximately four songs, during which time they experienced vivid visuals but remained aware of their safety. As the effects wore off gradually, they returned to normal with only subtle lingering visual effects and clammy hands."
457,47164,"The participant and a friend inhaled a small amount of powder after smoking marijuana. About five minutes later, they experienced burning sensations in their faces and noses. Fifteen minutes after inhalation, the pair moved to a quieter location where vomiting began and continued for approximately 25 minutes. Once the vomiting subsided, intense visual hallucinations occurred, lasting about six hours. The visuals included swirls of color and were accompanied by an emotional intensity that was not emotive in nature. Music played during this period enhanced their sensory experiences. They reported feeling as though they had redefined what the human mind could handle. The experience was described as more intense than previous trips on other substances like ketamine, but without confusion. The participant expressed a willingness to repeat the experience despite the initial discomfort of burning and vomiting."
458,95010,"The individual met with a friend who had money to purchase an unknown substance. After returning home, they mixed this substance with marijuana and smoked it together. The participant felt the effects of the substance after taking multiple hits and experienced visual distortions including fractals and eyeballs. They also perceived changes in gravity and physical surroundings, such as feeling like they were melting or being pulled to one side by gravity. After some time outside, they returned home where both individuals consumed alcohol."
459,56244,"The participant experienced a visual scene characterized by elegant, self-transforming jewel-like objects that rotated and changed shape and color. These objects were contained within an open box floating in the center of their vision. Behind this box, they perceived a majestic domed cavern embedded with hundreds of points of light, which simultaneously resembled both a dome and a dark blue star-filled sky. The edges of this scene were outlined by delicate black filigree, similar to a decorative border."
460,101850,"The participant experienced three separate sessions on an unknown substance. During the first session, they saw their name and the word ""waka"" appear in their field of vision. They perceived spirits around them but could only catch glimpses before they moved away. The spirits seemed pleased to see the participant.

In the second session, while staring at a poster of Bob Marley, the spirit of Bob Marley appeared and interacted with the participant for some time. This experience brought joy and near-tears to the participant.

During the third session, with eyes mostly closed, they experienced intricate and beautiful three-dimensional visual patterns."
461,97538,"The participant smoked 30mg of a substance in a marijuana pipe, experiencing immediate effects including room distortion similar to the peak of a mushroom trip. Closing their eyes revealed a visual of a capsule with powder inside, which grew arms and communicated with the participant, instructing them to follow it. The entity then built a glowing bridge for the participant to walk through, describing this as an out-of-body experience lasting approximately half an hour. As the effects began to wane, the trip became more dreamlike. The capsule entity told the participant it was time to return and invited them back soon. Upon opening their eyes, the participant felt exhausted and went to sleep."
462,88758,"The participant began by smoking a mixture containing an unknown substance along with cannabis. After several hits, they experienced intense visual distortions where their friends appeared to melt and the room seemed to crumble and dissolve. Closing their eyes led them to another universe that was described as amazing but indescribable.

Upon opening their eyes again, colors swirled around them, and people turned into rubber-like forms changing colors. The participant felt happier and excited after returning from this otherworldly experience. They reported a positive outlook and eagerness to repeat the journey."
463,82841,"The participant consumed an unknown substance and experienced what they perceived as death, entering a spiritual realm where their body was deconstructed into molecules. They felt connected to something greater but were terrified throughout the experience. Upon walking outside, the environment appeared transformed into a geometric, fractal landscape unlike anything in this world. Returning inside, the participant's perception of their own limbs changed, leading to a feeling of detachment from life. The experience concluded with a splitting headache and a newfound appreciation for both life and death."
464,61908,"The individual ingested two substances at around 2:00 AM but did not feel any significant effects for over an hour and a half. They remember watching part of a movie before losing consciousness. The next morning, they woke up at 8:00 AM with no recollection of the experience. Their friend reported that the individual turned off the TV while asleep and was laughing during this time."
465,54439,"The participant was introduced to a substance by a friend while studying for a test. They inhaled the substance through a rig and experienced an intense, fast-acting effect. Initially, they felt as if their head had been thrown into outer space, with their consciousness separating from their body. During this phase, they briefly saw their friend's distorted face nearby.

The experience then shifted dramatically when it seemed that their ""head"" returned to them, landing back in place. This moment was described as both remarkable and terrifying. The participant regained a sense of self but felt motivated not to repeat the experience for at least two years due to its intensity.

Afterwards, they resumed studying but noted that the experience had been brilliant despite being extremely intense."
466,109249,"The participant experienced two distinct trips involving a substance. During the first trip, alternating purple and yellow checkerboard visuals appeared before transitioning to an encounter with an entity described as having a long curly mustache, resembling Salvador Dali. This entity communicated through smiling, and the participant reciprocated. As the experience concluded, the entity bid farewell.

In the second trip, after insufflating the substance, the participant felt enclosed in what seemed like a womb. They engaged in dialogue with an entity that advised them on achieving greatness by simply continuing to live their life. Visuals included rapidly moving pink clouds."
467,69358,"The participant prepared a substance by extracting it from plant material and inhaling it using a bong with wormwood. Upon inhalation, they experienced immediate effects including visual patterns of flying colors and an army of people under their command. They engaged in a battle scene that felt life or death, ending victorious but bloodied. The experience lasted approximately 13 minutes before the participant regained awareness of their physical body and surroundings. Visuals similar to those from mushroom use were present for another minute after which normalcy returned within 20 minutes."
468,80766,"At a music festival in Michigan, the participant consumed a substance with several others from a bowl containing both crystals and marijuana. Upon inhalation, they experienced an intense wave of euphoria. Visual effects included vibrant kaleidoscopic shapes and colors that morphed when their eyes were closed. The sounds around them slowed down and became low-pitched before speeding up again. Additionally, the sound of balloons being inflated and deflated near them caused visual zooming in and out. This intense experience lasted about 10 minutes, followed by a mellow body buzz similar to that experienced after consuming another substance."
469,86495,"The participant began their experience feeling anxious and high from smoking marijuana before the main substance was consumed. They smoked a pipe containing the substance while listening to trippy music in a quiet room with two friends present. After inhaling the first hit, they felt everything vibrating and turning into waves both internally and visually. Closing their eyes after the second hit, they saw outlines of their friends where they were sitting.

The participant then experienced themselves as smoke flying back and forth within the pipe's stem, which was described as fun despite feeling tossed around. They also visualized an 80-foot tall leaf dripping water into a large pond, accompanied by music with water drop sounds. The trip lasted approximately three minutes before coming down quickly. Upon opening their eyes, they reported the experience felt longer than it actually was."
470,81808,"The participant experienced a series of intense and disorienting sensations during the trip. Initially, they felt as if they had died but later realized they were still connected to their body. They observed that their pupils appeared dilated with blue rims. The experience led them to contemplate philosophical concepts such as God, chaos, and the soul. They considered whether they were in hell or a divine realm and pondered the idea of conquering chaos through divine compassion. There was fear about becoming stuck in this state and not being able to return to their normal life."
471,86994,"The participant attended a festival where they consumed two doses of a substance and then inhaled a small amount of another substance from a pipe. After experiencing a melting sensation similar to that of Salvia Divinorum but more geometric, they saw an indoor landscape with triangular, iridescent columns and multicolored floors and ceilings while floating within it. The ambient psytrance music from outside transformed into a visual landscape, deepening the experience. Visual patterns from both substances combined, adding color and detail to fractal-like visuals. The atmosphere felt sacred and emotionally profound. After approximately ten minutes, the participant returned to a standard lysergic state."
472,56929,"The individual experienced an intense psychedelic trip in a wooded area after inhaling vapor from a pipe. Initially, they felt a strange taste and feared a seizure, but then saw their friend playing with sock poi through the rear-view mirror, reassuring them. Visuals rapidly changed colors, and objects appeared to melt into unfamiliar shapes with psychedelic hues. The participant heard an unclear guide-like voice during the experience. As reality slowly returned, they stepped out of the car and regained speech ability. Upon attempting to recount details to their friend later, specific memories began to fade."
473,92014,"The participant had two separate experiences. In the first, they ran barefoot through a canyon-like area, feeling connected to their surroundings. They stopped running at a gap and jumped over a tree while hearing bongo music in the background. The second experience was described as strange, with everything appearing blue and cold, and an uncomfortable sensation."
474,81081,"The participant experienced a sensation of their legs deteriorating into dust before regaining form.

The participant felt like they were one complete thing filled with light and gained insights into themselves and reality."
476,90251,"The narrator joined four others to smoke a substance mixed with marijuana on a walking trail near a college. After inhalation, the narrator experienced a pressure in the back of their neck that traveled up to their face. Visual distortions occurred, including trees appearing two-dimensional and the ground breathing and having a heartbeat. The group remained silent throughout the experience."
477,83408,"The participant and their friend prepared a substance on tinfoil and inhaled it. Upon inhalation, the participant felt as if reality was falling apart and initially thought they might die. They then relaxed and observed what they perceived as a symphony of the universe. The friend's experience involved encountering an entity that instructed them to stop smoking methamphetamine and leave town. This entity described having 'very high-end spaceships' and mentioned a demon, which the friend passed by. The friend returned later to ask more questions but felt a sense of imposition from the entities."
478,84633,"The participant smoked a substance using a bong with cannabis as a base. Within seconds, they experienced time and body sensations slowing down. Visual hallucinations included trees becoming colorful and rapidly dancing while spinning. Closing their eyes revealed two women hugging the participant; these entities were pulsating different colors, especially blue. The experience concluded with the participant feeling refreshed."
479,78233,"The participant began by taking a small dose of a fine, orange sherbet-colored powder through smoking. They noticed immediate effects within 10 seconds, experiencing colder extremities and sweaty palms. Colors appeared sharper and more pastel-like, with yellows becoming particularly vibrant. The closed-eye visuals were intense, featuring multidimensional rooms and shimmering patterns.

After the initial dose subsided quickly, they prepared another batch. This time, they felt a sense of megalomania and mild sexual stimulation but did not achieve a breakthrough experience. Psychologically, their reactions varied between regret (""when will this end"") and empowerment (""not to waste any time"").

The participant has not returned to the realm described in some time, though it was due to other reasons rather than a negative experience. They also attempted to use the substance during a sexual encounter but found its effects too subtle for that purpose."
480,60889,"The individual reported entering an altered state where they perceived a bright energy field at the 10 o'clock position that moved towards the 11 o'clock direction, but chose to move in the opposite direction towards the 3 o'clock position. At this location, they encountered approximately five entities resembling 'people' who were observing them.

When their eyes opened, faces appeared on the plywood above and around them, creating an impression of these entities being present everywhere. Closing their eyes again, they perceived layers of energy fields that seemed to be composed of smaller background entities.

The participant felt a loss of individual thought and described a state of simply 'being' in this altered reality. Upon regaining some control over their mind, they expressed gratitude for the experience and exclaimed ""Wow."""
481,47098,"The experience began 15 minutes after insufflation and reached peak intensity at 45 minutes before gradually tapering off around the hour mark. The individual reported a mix of positive and negative sensations, including being transported to an altered state of consciousness but struggling to return to normalcy afterwards. They noted the experience as both interesting and somewhat scary due to its intensity and rapid onset."
482,95015,"The participant experienced vivid visuals characterized by colorful geometric shapes and a slight orange hue. Their perception of the world became exaggerated and fantastical. The individual reported that their partner appeared with dreads resembling cartoon-colored lightning bolts. Music was perceived as slightly distorted, bending in pitch or timing. The experience was accompanied by intense feelings of joy and wonder."
483,66774,"The participant consumed an unknown substance for the first time with friends in a sand pit setting. After smoking approximately 10 mg of the substance, they experienced intense visual effects almost immediately. Trees above them appeared to circle together and the sky moved quickly while the sand turned shades of red. The initial experience was very intense and lasted about 15 minutes before wearing off. They then smoked another dose which came on more gradually and was described as enjoyable. During this second peak, they watched the sky for what felt like hours and reported loving every minute of it. The entire trip lasted approximately 45 minutes followed by a two-hour body high."
484,108955,"The participant smoked an unknown substance and immediately encountered a jester entity who began teasing them. In response, they consumed more of the substance. The jester then split into two forms; one remained as the original jester while the other transformed into a wise, beautiful goddess with arms on her hips. This new form sided with the participant against the jester and scolded him for pushing down on the participant. After this interaction, the goddess faded away, and the jester reformed into a single entity, laughing with the participant and promising not to tease them again, though he continued his teasing behavior shortly after."
485,31802,"The participant experienced an intense journey into what they perceived as another world shortly after consuming a substance. They found themselves in a forest riding a horse as a knight, searching for their lost love, the princess. After navigating through the forest and encountering various challenges, including battling monsters and a dragon, they reached a castle. The dragon was defeated with a sword thrown between its eyes, allowing them to enter the castle.

Upon entering the castle, the participant ascended many flights of stairs and eventually found a beautiful woman whom they identified as their princess. They kissed her before returning to reality on the couch. The entire experience felt like hours but only lasted until 8:23 PM. Post-trip effects included headaches and tingles in the back of the brain for several days.

A week later, the participant tried the substance again and experienced an out-of-body sensation, observing from above before returning to their body after about ten minutes."
486,51155,"The setting was a festival centered around a Grateful Dead cover band. The participant was tripping for about 6 hours when they encountered a vendor who had previously sold them ineffective substances. The participant confronted the vendor, leading to an exchange of substances that eventually resulted in a strong hallucinogenic experience.

During this experience, the participant's vision became extremely sharp and detailed, allowing them to perceive nature with heightened clarity. They reported feeling as though their body was surging with energy but did not want to move. The sun appeared to split into quadrants, and an entity communicated through sounds that were interpreted by the participant as divine messages.

The entity suggested it was the Holy Spirit or God itself, stating it could not speak directly without ceasing the participant's existence. Instead, the entity claimed to be present in everything around them. When the participant looked at a nearby girl, she appeared to shake and look away, suggesting an intense interaction with the participant's altered state.

After the immediate effects wore off, the participant felt transformed and was approached by various festival-goers who treated them as a spiritual guide or celebrity. The experience left a lasting impact on the participant, influencing their perception of reality for months afterward."
487,48312,"The experience began when the participant and a friend smoked a substance at around 9 pm. Initially, there were feelings of glee and excitement similar to those experienced while smoking marijuana. As they continued to smoke, perceptual changes became more pronounced. The participants encountered an entity referred to as ""the DMT,"" which was described as an evil creature intent on luring them into a forest where it dwelled.

""The DMT"" personified negative aspects of human nature and remained a significant presence in the lives of both participants after the experience. They smoked the substance again the following night, with similar results. The encounter with ""the DMT"" led to an awareness of the darker side of human nature for the participants."
488,34118,"The participant experienced vivid imagery and sensations while in a state influenced by an unknown substance. They perceived a white horse sheltering under a tree on a mountain, noting the hooves' presence as a hymn to leaves. Smoke from their mouth formed loops that dissipated into the air. The experience was filled with awe and joy, described as melting into ""a billion just Bee'Zzz."" There were mentions of pathways looping and laughing holes leading into space, creating a buzzing sensation followed by ripples of joyful chatter. They tasted juice dripping like sweat from the sun, feeling pleased beyond belief with simply existing. The participant felt a deep connection to nature, including the sun, a pine tree, and a river, expressing gratitude for these experiences."
489,14948,"The participant had their second drug experience in a secluded area within a community center's green walkways. After inhaling the substance through a pipe, they closed their eyes and saw fractal patterns in neutral colors such as purple, pink, and grey. These patterns were symmetrical and seemed to come from all planes.

A grandfatherly entity appeared, providing a sense of safety and guidance. The entity communicated that continuing forward was natural and right. This being offered care and protection, making the participant feel safe and supported, similar to how a caregiver would protect a child.

The experience also included a distant 'door' or barrier, which the participant felt they could reach if they had taken more of the substance or were less fearful. The entity encouraged the participant to move towards this door but did not force them.

The account concludes with reflections on whether the drug experience mimics near-death experiences and questions about consciousness and the nature of reality beyond physical death."
490,1850,"The participant reported an intense experience where visual distortions occurred rapidly, such as trees moving wildly and objects appearing to melt. The individual felt a loss of control over their environment and experienced discomfort from something dark but indescribable. They compared the feeling to tapping into a ""dark side,"" though this was metaphorical."
491,45012,"The participant prepared for the experience by creating a dark environment and smoking a strong dose of salvia divinorum. They reported feeling as if they were inside a rotating wheel-like structure with five spokes, each filled with light and colors. Through an opening in their chamber, they observed an external reality consisting of a grassy plain with countless feet moving to rotate the object they were in. This led to panic and fear about being separated from their familiar life.

After removing the blindfold, the participant gradually returned to normal consciousness but felt disoriented for some time. They experienced difficulty breathing and had irrational thoughts about being seen on drugs by others. The comedown was prolonged due to their struggle against the effects of the substance. The participant eventually went for a walk, got a shower, and felt more grounded."
492,91782,"The participant prepared for the journey by studying information about the substance in advance, smoking some dry leaves to establish a baseline, and discussing previous experiences with their friend who served as a sitter. The setting was dimly lit, comfortable, and quiet. 

Upon inhaling the substance, the individual immediately felt themselves transported into another realm characterized by red and orange colors that were morphing and spinning. This place was filled with entities similar in appearance to the participant, all of whom were spirits composed of red, orange, and black hues. The participant recognized this realm as familiar but could not determine if it was good or bad.

The experience was three-dimensional and continuously moving without blurring. The entities present were numerous and indistinguishable from one another, yet each had a sense of familiarity to the participant. The participant felt they had entered a one-way door and would not be able to return to their previous reality. They described this place as a ""spinning cathedral of souls"" or like being in church.

The participant observed glimpses of their former life passing by three times, each time in blue and green colors, but concluded that reentry was unlikely due to the rapid movement around them. After an unspecified duration, the participant found themselves back in their original world, feeling shocked and amazed at the return. They experienced several stages of recovery, including a period where they could manipulate reality by waving their hands.

The sitter played a crucial role in helping the participant recall details about the journey through simple questions."
493,72247,"The participant smoked an unknown substance for the fifth time alone. They experienced intense visual distortions, including warped perceptions at the edges of their vision and a striped, banded appearance to everything. Initially, they felt intensely paranoid about setting off a fire with the pipe and became confused about their surroundings, believing it might be a dream or that the world was constructed for them.

The participant heard music playing on TV but perceived it as endlessly repeating and directed at them personally. They saw flat tube shapes in the video images and changed channels, finding similar shapes everywhere. The song 'All Right Now' seemed to mock their mental state while also reassuring them they were all right.

Feeling overwhelmed by panic, confusion, and awe, the participant bolted for the front door but found standing difficult due to dizziness. They lay on the porch steps, rolling from side to side before returning inside. The song 'A Touch of Grey' by the Grateful Dead came on next, which they perceived as telling them they would survive.

As the intensity lessened, the participant's surroundings began to seem safe and normal again, though strange thoughts continued. They realized their concept of self was merely an idea and felt alienated from plants, which radiate outward without a sense of left or right."
494,83979,"The experience began gradually over 30 minutes with multiple doses taken sublingually. Initially, no effects were noticed, but after about 20 minutes, visual hallucinations appeared when closing or blinking eyes, including shapes and eventually a parade of bikini-clad women floating past. Time perception was altered; focusing on internal thoughts slowed time compared to external stimuli.

At the peak dose, the participant felt their mouth transform into a building with themselves standing on their tongue. They perceived objects rolling off the balcony as tincture moving in their mouth. An auditory presence was noted, initially thought to be another entity but later identified as the sound of a laptop power adapter. The participant interacted with this presence by unplugging and replugging the adapter.

As the experience tapered off, music was played, and the participant perceived faces in light shows that may have been pre-existing."
495,102590,"The participant experienced a powerful effect after inhaling a substance. Initially, they felt an electrical current running through their body and a sensation of gravity pulling them down and to the left. After several seconds, they entered a state where nothing existed around them for what seemed like an eternity. This was followed by a repetition of their entire life up until that point.

The participant then ""woke up"" or ""had always been in"" a space that felt like death but lasted for an aeon. In this space, the world appeared as a colorful, tilt-shifted surreal landscape with 360-degree vision. They saw bright grassy green and yellow colors repeated in a hilly fashion, resembling a field from a fly's perspective.

Two entities were present in front of them, appearing to judge and intimidate the participant. These entities had eyes that resembled those of Horus, wore mythical purple clothing, and had blazing orange hair and skin like the sun during a coronal mass ejection. The entities seemed intrusive and threatening, with their gaze on the participant.

After what felt like an eternity, the landscape collapsed in on itself, folding inward until everything became a dull white light that was also black. The participant then remembered being inside a tent and scrambled to get out. Upon exiting, they felt uncomfortable and irritable, as if waking up from a long period of hyper-sleep.

The experience left lasting effects, with the world appearing yellow-tinted for 24 hours afterward. The participant reported feeling that their innocence had died during this experience and that it changed them profoundly."
496,76219,"The participant smoked a small amount of dried leaves in a pipe with friends present as sitters. After inhaling deeply, they experienced an immediate wave of non-being followed by a sensation of being transported back to their childhood. The word ""Trameldacom"" was perceived as having immense meaning and significance during this period.

Upon regaining some awareness, the participant noticed that others in the room seemed distant in time rather than space. They walked around the kitchen, feeling strange, and returned to lie down in the same spot where they initially experienced the childhood sensation. The participant felt a strong sense of nostalgia and believed lying there would take them back to their childhood.

The participant then moved into another part of the room but continued to feel as if they were in the back of the apartment despite changing positions. They crawled under a table, feeling trapped, before eventually standing up again. In the bedroom, the participant felt that every molecule and atom was tangible and supported them, allowing them to stand straight.

Over the next 15-20 minutes, the participant gradually returned to a normal state of mind while recounting their experiences to friends. The peak experience lasted approximately 20-25 minutes according to observers, though the participant perceived it differently. The following morning, they felt almost completely normal with only slight dizziness and visual wavering."
497,89305,"The participant had two trips that significantly altered their perception and reality. During the first trip, they experienced visual distortions such as fragmented vision and an overwhelming sensation of heat and panic. They felt watched by others in the room who seemed to be controlled by a single entity. The second trip was more intense and lasted longer. After inhaling the substance, the participant's consciousness separated from their body, entering a chaotic void filled with alien colors and forms. They heard voices that they later realized were from friends watching their physical form.

The participant perceived an endless stream of reality, which they interpreted as a time stream, leading to existential realizations about the nature of time and existence. They questioned whether what they experienced was hallucination or actuality. The trip progressed to a point where the participant felt on the verge of transcending known consciousness. However, doubt set in, causing the perceived reality to dissipate.

The participant then saw solid objects as illusions blocking an underlying stream of time, leading them to question the nature of their perception and reality. They experienced paranoia about a higher consciousness (dubbed RAMSES) manipulating their perceptions. The trip ended with visual distortions such as repeating images and glitches in music perception. After the trip, the participant felt confused and bewildered, questioning the authenticity of their experiences."
498,74891,"The participant smoked an unnamed substance outdoors on their balcony after drinking several beers. They collapsed immediately and were helped up the stairs by their girlfriend, Tabitha. During this ascent, the participant experienced vivid green visuals and felt like they were floating through a birth canal. The second attempt was done indoors while lying down, resulting in choking sounds and drooling. After regaining consciousness, the participant saw everything surrounded by a glowing light and felt as if they were made of plastic or wearing a space suit."
499,57140,"The individual prepared themselves mentally before consuming a substance through inhalation. They immediately experienced vivid hallucinations where they perceived it was raining heavily outside despite no actual rain occurring. They felt their body transform into a wooden structure, taking on vibrant colors. Neighboring houses also appeared as wooden and plastic structures with human-like features that communicated with the participant.

The entities instructed the participant to look up at the sky, where they saw an approaching massive entity descending upon them. The participant expressed fear and begged for mercy but felt trapped like the other beings around them. They managed to break free from their wooden state and fell to the floor in a fetal position, crying out of relief.

The entities then lifted the participant off the ground and carried them back to their bedroom, where they placed them gently on the bed before vanishing through the walls. The individual gradually returned to reality, feeling confused but relieved. They experienced lingering physical effects similar to an intense cannabis high, feeling seamlessly connected with their surroundings."
500,21222,"The participant began by inhaling two hits of a substance, experiencing initial psychedelic effects after the second hit. They felt their body become numb and experienced difficulty sitting upright. The room appeared to move and change visually, with lighting altering and walls seeming to tear apart in places where shadows met smoke. A voice communicated telepathically, offering the participant a piece of the world and instructing them to form their arms into a C shape.

The experience progressed to include visions of the planet as a ball of liquid energy, with each soul having a part to play in its maintenance. The participant felt they had discovered profound truths about existence and the interconnectedness of all beings on Earth. They experienced a sense of flying around the galaxy while observing the Earth from space.

When their wife began her experience, the participant tried to communicate but found that time seemed frozen and reality was malleable based on imagination. As the effects wore off, they felt claustrophobic and worried about re-entering normal life. The substance provided a message that both participants were soulmates and existed as one entity, with each creating the other through their thoughts."
501,42505,"The participant began their experience with an unnamed substance by taking several hits in quick succession until they felt the effects peak. During this period, visual distortions occurred, such as colors brightening and patterns warping. The participant reported feeling on the verge of entering a new state but being pulled back to a mildly psychedelic plateau.

For their third attempt, the participant took a larger dose indoors with a friend present. They smoked the substance in two hits from a bubbler and one hit from a pipe, reaching the peak halfway through the second toke. During this period, they experienced intense disorientation and a sense of becoming a new life form. The outside world was no longer perceivable, but there was a vague awareness that someone was watching them.

The participant attempted to communicate with their friend during the experience, speaking in spastic moans and glossolalia. They felt an overwhelming hilarity and tried to express it despite the difficulty of forming words. Time became distorted, and physical space seemed trivial as they felt spread through a nonlocal field of mind.

As the effects began to wear off, the participant experienced confusion and difficulty reconnecting with their regular world. They expressed fear that their perception had been permanently altered and struggled to understand what had happened during the peak experience."
502,50324,"The participant smoked an extract of Salvia divinorum in their bedroom under dim lighting. They initially experienced visual effects similar to those from cannabis, including stationary visuals and a hand with an index finger pointing up. As the experience progressed, they felt environmental disturbances such as hypersensitivity to light and temperature changes. The participant also perceived a powerful, alien presence that caused them initial panic but eventually led to curiosity.

The experience included a sensation of being bisected horizontally, which was followed by the appearance of a tentacle-like entity emerging from a crevice. This entity interacted with the participant in various ways, such as rotating in front of them and tickling them. Through this interaction, the participant learned about their own intentionality and the obstacles that hinder its expression, including guilt, fear, uncertainty, and fakeness paranoia.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling a newfound freedom from fear and shame, allowing them to extend their intentionality without hesitation or worry."
503,32623,"The participant prepared for the experience by positioning themselves comfortably on a carpeted floor with a mattress as back support. The sitter was present and cross-legged next to them, wearing casual clothing. After inhaling two hits of the substance, the effects began almost immediately. 

Initially, the room appeared to soften and edges blurred, creating a tunnel vision-like effect. Subtle vibrations were felt throughout the body, which became warmer as the experience progressed. The participant closed their eyes and entered a swirling visual state with repeating patterns in greenish hues.

A recurring entity, described as a clown dressed in a white suit, was observed outside the room. This figure had red puffy hair, a small nose, and wore makeup. It did not directly interact but was positioned to do something.

The environment transformed into what appeared to be a playpen with sponge-like walls and a dark, smoky appearance. The floor was colored white/brown/green, contrasting the actual dark blue carpet. Tiles on one wall resembled fingernails. 

The participant noted that while they were in this altered state, the sitter remained unaffected. They expressed amazement at the transformation of their surroundings and interacted with the sitter's brassiere, which seemed to grow towards them.

An entity resembling an ice-cream man/clown began pitching ice cream bars into the playpen, some merging with the tiles on the wall. The participant felt a strong connection to the sitter's hands, describing them as feeling good and noticing a soft orange layer over her hands.

As the experience waned, the participant held the sitter's hand and communicated that it was ending soon. They experienced pins-and-needles in their left leg before lying down next to the sitter for comfort."
504,19206,"The participant began by preparing an extract of a substance, which they ingested after socializing with friends who were also drinking alcohol. Upon inhaling the substance, the individual experienced immediate and intense effects. They felt as if they had entered another reality where everything seemed like a delusion or a movie. Conversations around them took on a different meaning; instead of hearing normal dialogue, they perceived underlying messages that suggested everyone was aware of their impending realization.

The participant ran inside, feeling as though they were already a ghost and no longer mattered in the physical world. They lay down on their bed, clutching it tightly, while everything else dissolved into insignificance. The room seemed to dissolve, leaving only their hands and bed visible. They heard neighbors talking about them, laughing at their role in the participant's life delusion.

After a few minutes, the desire to return to normalcy emerged. The individual managed to rejoin friends outside but found reality still felt strange and molten. Conversations gradually made sense again as if they were surfacing from deep waters. Friends continued to talk about mundane subjects, which now seemed like subliminal messages.

The participant took another hit of the substance, leading to a blackout and physical discomfort upon regaining consciousness. They drank wine for grounding and eventually passed out. Two days later, they felt weak but were returning to normal. The experience left them questioning its purpose and feeling betrayed by the substance that had previously been kind to them."
505,16151,"The experience began with visual distortions where zipper-like patterns appeared across the room, running parallel to the floor. The participant's perception of depth flattened, creating layers that resembled freestanding cardboard cutouts of objects in the room. Several entities resembling friends were present but attached to these lines in an indescribable way.

The idea was conveyed that these beings held reality together and their detachment from the lines would unzip reality. This realization caused intense fear as one entity began unzipping, creating a black void between sections of reality. The participant felt they controlled this process but lost control when the entities turned forceful and chased them through the house.

Panic ensued as the participant fled outside, still perceiving themselves as a zipper head unzipping reality behind them. Reality continued to unzip until four lines converged on the participant. A friend appeared, asking why they were outside, bringing the experience back to normalcy.

The entire episode was vivid and real during its occurrence, with the participant retaining clear memories afterward."
506,33014,"The individual began in a depressed state before consuming mushrooms and salvia. While under the influence of mushrooms, they consumed salvia from a bong. The effects were immediate and intense, causing them to feel as if their consciousness was being sliced apart and spread across infinite space. They experienced vivid patterns and shapes moving through what felt like their mind's sky. These sensations were both frightening and awe-inspiring.

As the experience peaked, they perceived themselves surrounded by plant-like vibrations and felt a message from the substance urging gratitude for life. The trip concluded with silver fish swimming past them before rejoining reality. Afterward, the individual reported feeling more grateful and aware of the profound nature of existence, shifting their perspective on life's challenges."
507,5365,"The participant smoked an unknown substance for the first time at a friend's house along with his brother, wife, and others. After inhaling two large hits, he experienced a sudden onset of intense physical sensations including heat rushing up his body and a feeling of being pulled towards another dimension. His visual field was bisected by a colorful diagonal line, which seemed to be sucking his consciousness into it.

The participant felt as though his soul was being rolled up like a window shade, leading him to believe he was dying or entering an altered state of reality. He could not make out the faces of those around him and perceived them as parts of his psyche illustrating his inner dialog. The voices in his head were echoed by people in the room speaking his thoughts aloud.

The experience peaked with intense fear and a desire to return to normal consciousness, which was expressed verbally but also mimicked by others present. As the effects began to fade, he realized what had happened and discussed it with his brother on the way home."
508,345,"The participant had their first substantive experiences with a psychedelic substance on two separate occasions. During the first session, after inhaling the substance, they felt heavy limbs and tingling sensations. Their vision became detailed but limited in peripheral field. They experienced being sucked backward through a membrane-like barrier, feeling as if everything was turning hard or to stone. This created an overwhelming sensation of death, which they stopped by force of will. The membrane appeared as creamy white taffy with chocolate swirls moving with the music.

After about half an hour, the participant returned to reality, noticing lingering visual effects similar to LSD or mushrooms. In reflection, they felt their consciousness was attempting to pass through the barrier and that fear had halted this process.

In the second session a week later, after inhaling more of the substance, the participant experienced pressure from the top of their head, splitting them into two halves. Their body became a membrane that split in two directions, eventually re-merging like lava flows. Embedded within were countless different realities, one notably being a street corner.

The participant then felt enveloped by a feminine presence, which communicated through unspoken words that these realities could be chosen to return to from this place. The room and the friend passed through the membrane, and upon choosing the current reality, the participant's body returned. They opened their eyes, laughed, and were back to baseline within minutes."
509,2138,"The individual began by inhaling a dose after preparing themselves with another substance. As they lay in darkness, they became acutely aware of their breathing, feeling it as both a personal and universal rhythm. A sense of something unfolding emerged, leading to thoughts about an ancient, unspoken truth that was trying to be remembered.

They felt like an unspeakably old entity, the center and boundary of all things, connected through time to their ancestors. The experience included visualizations of themselves as a trunk pushing up through ages with flowers waving like tiny eyes. They thought specifically of their grandfather, seeing him as a symbol of wisdom and conviction, and felt a connection to his legacy.

The presence left after about 20-30 minutes, leaving the participant in contemplation of what had occurred. The experience was described as profound yet dispassionate at the time, with the emotional impact becoming more pronounced afterward when trying to articulate it."
510,97683,"The individual began their experience by inhaling a substance from a bowl, which immediately caused them to feel reality slipping away. They observed thick white smoke pouring out of their mouth, feeling connected to it as if everything was stretching and elongating. After the second inhalation, they entered a state of brilliant white nothingness, with no sense of body or surroundings except for an empty spherical world.

A slow, muffled feminine voice seemed both far away and inside them, teaching about creation. The participant saw distorted cartoonish figures in two-dimensional form, mostly white with red edges fading into yellow tints. These figures were engaged in a factory-like process where things were being created on a production line. As the experience progressed, the individual began to see themselves as part of this process, being formed from slices that stretched and rotated like liquid mercury.

The participant felt physically connected to these white slices, which were pulling them away from the blank whiteness while also wanting to remain in it. They counted aloud the number of slices forming them, expressing fear about not having enough to become fully three-dimensional again. The individual tried to communicate this experience to Jamie, who was present but whose presence became unclear at times.

Jamie reached out to touch the participant, intensifying their guilt and desire for the experience to end. The participant felt physically connected to Jamie during this time. When reality began to return, the participant heard slowed-down music like in a Charlie Brown special. They could feel Jamie's arm behind them and holding their hand, still feeling physically part of each other.

As familiar objects in the room started to come into focus again, the participant tried to describe the experience but felt it slipping away. A sense of overwhelming gratitude for Jamie's presence and love was accompanied by fear of insanity or death."
511,12394,"The participant consumed an extract from a plant and reported feeling calm but excited before smoking it through a homemade water-pipe. After inhaling the substance, they experienced a vivid mental adventure that felt like being part of a game show, searching for reality with a new identity. The experience was described as fun and not fearful.

They saw their desk and water pipe in what seemed to be an altered state, laughing at the realization of returning to ""reality."" Upon smoking another bowl, they perceived faces in the burning material and felt that their blue glass water pipe and desk transformed into a street scene. The substance appeared to grow from the desk, creating a game-like push-and-pull sensation with green buildings.

The participant eventually returned to their room, questioning whether they had ever left or if they were still in an altered state. They smoked until the extract was finished but did not experience further significant effects. The entire episode lasted about 20 minutes, followed by another 20 minutes of returning to a waking state consciousness."
512,116803,"The participant prepared for the experience by consuming kratom and hydroxyzine and engaging in meditation and listening to Christian music. They chewed hydrated salvia leaves for about 15 minutes before noticing slight effects, including warmth and positive energy. As the effects intensified, they experienced two-dimensional vision and complex 3D structures, such as a rainbow-colored tunnel. At around 28 minutes into the experience, they spit out the remaining leaves and juices.

While meditating to Christian music, the participant saw a white circular patch of light in their vision that changed shape with breathing. They felt an intense warm, tingly sensation starting from the top of their head and radiating downwards. The meditation led to thoughts about God's creation, interconnectedness, beauty, and love. The participant also interacted with their kitten, seeing it as an equal and reflecting on animal suffering.

The experience included spiritual insights, such as recognizing their own goodness despite past mistakes and deciding against suicide. They felt a strong desire to appreciate life more and improve themselves. After the trip subsided, they went for a walk outside to further reflect on nature's beauty."
513,107250,"The participant smoked a small amount of Salvia for their first experience, feeling excited and anticipating the effects. Upon inhaling, they saw a tunnel-like vision filled with light blue colors from a YouTube video playing on the TV. They felt as if they were in another place with familiar people (wife and coworker) waiting for someone else to join them (father). This dreamlike state lasted about 30 minutes subjectively but was only four minutes of real time.

For their second experience, the participant smoked a slightly larger amount of Salvia. The effects were more intense and overwhelming. They felt as if something was coming after them, with blankets and pillows acting like enemy agents trying to suppress them. This led to frantic behavior where they threw items around and tried to organize objects on the coffee table before realizing it was due to an upcoming vocal entrance in a song playing.

The participant then turned off the TV but still felt threatened by something unseen. They moved to their bedroom, tossing and turning uncomfortably while feeling angry at the effects of Salvia. Closing their eyes brought waves of ancient symbols that further distressed them. After verbalizing that it was just the effects of the substance, they gradually returned to a normal state."
514,81574,"The individual smoked one large hit of salvia while lying in bed with a playlist playing softly in the background. Upon inhaling, they felt themselves sinking into the pillows and experienced visual distortions, seeing a yellow surface that resembled sunflower petals growing everywhere. A giant rolling sunflower appeared, lifting them up as it rotated slowly. The participant observed similar flowers across an endless landscape of yellow.

During one rotation, a brown-skinned male figure reached out from the ground in the hallucination and was pulled onto the rotating flower. This entity seemed friendly but did not communicate verbally. As the flower completed its second rotation, the individual felt themselves rising back to reality gently, as if emerging from a swimming pool. They returned to their bed, stating ""wow, that was really weird.""

After the experience, which lasted about three minutes in real time, they watched visualizations on the TV for another 20-30 minutes before sleeping soundly with no dreams. The next day and over the following days, they experienced brief moments of zoning out at work and feeling slightly clouded in their mind."
515,81020,"The participant began their experience by inhaling a psychoactive substance from a pipe. Within seconds, they felt disoriented and spacey. Visual hallucinations soon followed, initially appearing as graph paper-like squares that protruded in front of them, colored orange and yellow. These visual distortions were replaced by an opening resembling a portal to an old library filled with countless leather-bound books, symbolizing human knowledge.

The participant attempted to enter this library but was pulled back into their chair by the voices of their friends, which appeared as gray smoke. They felt irritated by this interference and eventually the portal faded away. A sense of clarity and understanding then washed over them, followed by a perception of time travel while staring at a clock with fluctuating times.

The participant also experienced empathy for one of the dogs present, feeling its sadness and sympathy towards it. As the effects began to wane, they observed the room pulling away from them or themselves being pulled away from the rest of the environment. They had vivid imaginations when closing their eyes, akin to watching a movie on the inside of their eyelids.

The experience concluded with feelings of highness, unbalance, and confusion that gradually faded over the next hour. The participant felt calm and relaxed for the remainder of the day, taking a nap around 4:00 pm."
516,116017,"The participant began the session feeling relaxed and comfortable in a well-lit room with calming music playing. After inhaling the substance, they experienced their body becoming paralyzed starting from the lips and spreading outward. They felt immersed in fluttering membranes with changing colors, primarily yellow, blue, and crimson. There was an idea of always being in this place which seemed comforting.

As the experience progressed, there were sensations of soft suction cups trying to lift parts of the body such as eyelids and arms. The participant developed a pulsating sensation in their lips and fingertips that synchronized with the music. They perceived themselves as part of the colorful patterns and rhythms rather than an observer.

The sitter was present but not interacted with during the peak experience. As the effects wore off, the participant attempted to communicate they were okay, though speech was slurred. The entire experience lasted about twenty minutes, after which the participant returned to reality feeling calm and lassitude."
517,78263,"The experience began with the user laying down and closing their eyes after inhaling a substance. They entered a state where they had no concept of self or past experiences, feeling like they were starting existence anew. During this first 'plane' of consciousness, they tried to climb an integrated wheel of floor and music without understanding why.

After reaching over a node on the wheel, the user experienced a burst of realization, recognizing the wheel as such and themselves as an individual with a sense of self. In this second plane, they reflected on their previous state and engaged in the activity of climbing the wheel, finding pleasure in it.

The next significant moment came when another burst of realization flooded back the entire life history of the user, making them aware that they were hallucinating and causing panic. The music intensified into a pillar of water, overwhelming but also elating the user. They laughed and tried to interact with this new reality before being directed back onto the bed by friends.

Finally, the user experienced another realization, returning to 'real' reality where they could move around normally again. This transition was marked by relief and some lingering disorientation. The entire experience lasted about 10 minutes but felt much longer due to its intensity."
518,115813,"The participant began by preparing the substance carefully and consuming it in six portions over time. They experienced subtle sensations initially but became more aware after the fourth portion. As they continued chewing, they felt a separation between their cerebral hemispheres, often referred to as the ""zipper"" feeling. The ego tried to anchor them, but they let go.

After the fifth portion, an entity was perceived in their mind, described as feminine and communicating through the psychoactive compound. They welcomed this entity and felt a download-like sensation spreading throughout their body, culminating in a transformation into a fish swimming in an underwater world while still aware of being on a couch. This lasted for a few minutes before they were gently brought back by the plant consciousness.

Next, they experienced circular patterns forming behind closed eyes, resembling a mandala. They then felt like their mind was ascending but had concerns about potential disturbances from outside noise. These thoughts anchored them slightly to reality, and after some time, they consciously returned to their body, moving fingers and toes before getting up and turning on the lights.

The experience lasted approximately 45 minutes to an hour and was described as more relaxed compared to previous experiences with this substance."
519,115678,"The participant prepared a quid from 2.5 grams of dried leaf material and began chewing it while lying in bed with their eyes covered. They experienced increasing anxiety as they waited for effects to manifest. Around ten minutes into the experience, faint female vocalizations were heard but later ceased. The participant felt a light mental fog and slight confusion.

At around twenty minutes, the participant reported feeling stretched and spun-around sensations, which they attributed to sleepiness rather than the substance. They experienced hypnagogic images of cheering crowds and marbles in their head. By thirty minutes, the room appeared to shift colors from red to blue, and a fisheye effect was observed on a shadow in the room.

At forty minutes, tiny streaks of light resembling comets were seen at the bottom of the participant's vision. Around fifty minutes, a faint female voice asked ""How are you doing?"" near the participant. The experience peaked around this time with sedation and restlessness. After an hour, the participant felt mostly normal but noted lingering weirdness for another half-hour."
520,12760,"The participant prepared for their experience by recruiting two guides and setting up a dark, quiet environment. After inhaling a large dose of smoke from a water pipe, they entered an altered state characterized by intense visual and auditory hallucinations. They perceived themselves spinning into a colorful vortex leading to what felt like the core of matter, time, space, and thought.

In this dimension, the participant felt watched by entities that seemed familiar but were difficult to describe. These beings appeared to be partially from their own world, similar to characters in movies crossing between dimensions. The experience was disorienting, with a sense of losing connection to reality and an overwhelming feeling of having seen too much.

The participant's guides held onto them physically, attempting to keep them grounded as they struggled with the intensity of the trip. They yelled for help and felt like they were falling into another dimension. Their guides were deeply disturbed by their behavior and vowed never to try the substance again.

Overall, the experience was described as extremely intense and frightening but also intriguing, leading the participant to consider repeating it in the future despite its challenges."
521,12342,"The participant began experiencing effects approximately five minutes after smoking a small amount of an unknown substance. Initially, the room appeared distorted dimensionally, leading to the perception of being hung upside-down on an infinitely long conveyor belt. The conveyor belt had bumps that hit the participant's head in rhythm with their heartbeat.

Subsequently, the visual field fragmented into a wall of television screens showing two-dimensional images that rapidly became smaller and blurred out. The participant felt trapped within these hallucinations but could control their body enough to call for help. Friends assisted by calling emergency services and splashing water over them.

Upon returning to some semblance of reality, the participant described seeing cardboard cutouts of people in impossible sizes overlapping each other. They experienced a sense of detachment from physical space and time, perceiving everything as if on a screen. During this period, they were transported to an ambulance where their mouth felt extremely dry, imagining a rocky desert landscape around it.

At the hospital, the participant saw the room as two-dimensional but bent and waving like a screen. They perceived time and space as a gigantic sphere and experienced further visions of a dragon made up of colored points on a black infinite landscape and a peaceful boat ride in a black environment. The experience concluded with the realization that they were back in reality, marveling at their ability to perceive things in three dimensions again."
522,114764,"The participant had two experiences with a psychoactive substance. In the first experience, they smoked a small amount and experienced visual distortions such as swelling images on the TV screen and an animated bird that appeared to be in distress. The second experience involved smoking a larger dose outside. They felt the world spinning and saw themselves suspended in a cartoon-like green world with men spinning endlessly to piano music. A princess figure was present, expressing disappointment.

After another dosage, they experienced intense visual distortions of their surroundings, feeling as if the scene before them had been painted onto cellophane and slapped onto their face. The image transformed into parallel lines and then a single flailing string in a dark purple void. They blacked out and upon regaining consciousness, felt trapped in this void with tormenting voices mocking them.

Two geometric shapes resembling space ships appeared and began cutting through the purple void, revealing something behind it. These shapes were perceived as needing help from the participant, who realized their hand was one of these shapes. The rescue culminated in an explosion that freed the participant back to reality on the porch, where they felt grateful for another chance at life."
523,104398,"The participant smoked an extract of a psychoactive substance in a quiet, dark room while lying down with eyes closed. They experienced rapid immersion into an energy field shortly after inhalation. At T+30 seconds, they felt great stillness and amplification of inner experience, time seemed to slow or stop, and there was a sense of spaciousness and calmness described as attunement to a higher consciousness.

At T+1 minute, the participant lost awareness of themselves as an individual and became simply aware of energy in motion. By T+2 minutes, they were preoccupied with questions about their identity and origin, feeling anxious but also finding humor in the situation. They regained awareness of being in a body after about 5 minutes.

For the next 10-40 minutes, there was a sense of tremendous peace and spaciousness. The participant took a deep breath, which they described as wonderful, and felt somatic nuances of that breath deeply. They expressed amazement at returning to their body and experienced continued peace for about 30 minutes after opening their eyes.

The sitter reported concern over the participant not breathing during the peak experience but was reassured by the participant's explanation that they were outside of time and did not need to breathe then."
524,114413,"The participant began by chewing 51.2 grams of fresh Salvia leaves after fasting for the day. They experienced a gradual onset of effects around 10 minutes in, characterized by a fuzzy buzzing and slight warmth. At approximately 15 minutes, the intensity rapidly increased, causing the sensation of their body expanding and merging with surroundings.

During this peak experience, they perceived intricate visual patterns resembling layered reality connectors or zippers, described as small hexagonal tubes in greens and neon glows. The participant felt a sense of reality being torn apart and reassembled, leading to an overwhelming feeling of cosmic revelation and existential questioning.

The experience included moments of intense fear and darkness, reminiscent of previous psychedelic trips, but these subsided quickly. As the peak effects diminished after about 30 minutes, the participant reported milder visual and sensory experiences, including dream-like surfaces and slow spinning structures in their field of vision.

After approximately an hour and a half, the experience had largely faded into an afterglow, characterized by subtle visions and a sense of internal clarity. The participant felt light and floaty but was able to move about normally. They concluded that while the experience was intense and transformative, it did not leave lasting negative effects."
525,73035,"The participant began by smoking an unspecified substance through a water pipe and holding the smoke for several seconds. After a few moments, they experienced tingling sensations in their fingers, limbs, and throat but focused more on the visual and mental aspects of the experience rather than physical sensations.

They found themselves at the edge of what appeared to be a massive organic tower structure with numerous digit-like outcroppings extending in all directions. The towers were interconnected at their base, forming an intricate network that spread into a vast, black void beyond. Each tower was composed of smaller units or ""building blocks,"" and the participant felt they were one such unit on the tip of one of these structures.

The towers communicated with each other through synchronized thought-movement patterns, which the participant could perceive both mentally and visually. They described a sense of collective harmony among the entities within this structure, all working towards a common goal, likely growth. The communication was often emotional in nature, manifesting as physical sensations or visual ripples across the surface of the structures.

The participant noticed that they were facing outward from the organism while other units faced inward. When questioned by another tower about their presence outside, they responded apologetically and with some difficulty. This led to a period where the participant alternated between being inside and outside the structure, experiencing vivid images and emotions related to personal connections and memories.

Inside the organism, the participant saw complex networks of relationships represented as vines connecting different individuals. They recognized their own house from childhood and felt a strong emotional connection to it. The experience also highlighted an unresolved bond with someone significant in their life, possibly their fiancé, which prevented them from fully separating from the structure.

As the effects began to wear off, the participant briefly regained awareness of their physical surroundings but continued to reflect on the nature of the experience. They wondered if what they saw was accessible only after death and speculated about the importance of resolving personal bonds before achieving a permanent state outside the organism.

The account concludes with the participant's belief that there were other entities like themselves within the structure, suggesting that this kind of enlightenment or understanding is attainable for others as well."
526,84314,"The participant began by chewing on dried plant material for about 10 minutes before spitting it out. As they continued to chew a second quid, they experienced the first signs of altered perception, such as patterns in their vision. They then smoked some of the same substance, which intensified their experience.

During this time, the participant reported feeling a definite presence and being guided by an entity that communicated with them through a ""guiding voice."" This voice provided instructions on how to proceed deeper into the experience, including breath control techniques. The participant felt mocked up and directed throughout the journey.

The experience included visualizations of light-filled caverns where thoughts and imagination could roam freely. However, the participant struggled with intrusive analytical thoughts that they had to push away in order to fully immerse themselves in the experience. They described a sense of being dragged through various pathways and doorways, each leading to new sensations and realizations.

The journey concluded with the participant slowly decompressing and falling asleep, experiencing dreams attributed to the afterglow effect of the substance."
527,88179,"The participant began by experimenting with a small amount of dried leaves in a pipe, experiencing mild tingling sensations and a slight pressure inside the head. On subsequent occasions, they increased the dosage and used a water bong for better inhalation. During these sessions, they reported visual hallucinations such as swirling rooms, colorful pillars forming a cathedral-like roof, and being separated into three parts vertically. They also experienced auditory hallucinations where music seemed to control their body movements.

The participant described feeling very happy and welcomed by an unseen entity that was beckoning them. This entity was perceived as friendly and inviting. The experience included moments of clarity and understanding about the ""rightness"" of things, though they struggled with articulating these feelings verbally. They also noted a return to speaking English despite primarily using German in their daily life.

In one session, the participant felt transported to an open field where they stood as a brown pole with four yellow lines extending from them into the distance. This vision was interrupted by sounds from their partner's computer activities. Another attempt allowed for a more sustained experience of colorful and patterned visuals accompanied by music, which created a sense of awe and reverence.

The participant expressed amazement at how quickly they could transition between realities and noted that even minor disturbances like page turning or keyboard clicks could disrupt the experience."
528,112812,"The participant smoked a generous amount of a substance from a bong while listening to music in a darkened room. Upon inhaling, they felt their body vibrate intensely and experienced a strong taste that was both alien and pleasurable. Looking out the window, they saw an ornament on a balcony and felt disconnected from reality, as if they had done something wrong and would be laying there for days or weeks.

The participant then entered a tunnel with orange walls, feeling like their consciousness was being ripped apart while everything rotated counter-clockwise. A presence in the tunnel communicated to them that they had no idea what they did and that it was their fault the world was gone. The next scene showed the participant's body fused with a couch, both of a solid blue color, causing intense fear and panic.

The music ""Legalize It"" by Peter Tosh played, which heightened the participant's confusion and anxiety as they couldn't comprehend how it got there. They felt their body being forced through a small space like a steam roller, experiencing layers of consciousness being ripped apart and sent to a break room in an empty white plane.

As reality began to return, the participant tried moving their arm but experienced pain similar to ripping Velcro from their skin. After a few minutes, they were relaxed and reflective."
529,111977,"The participant begins by recounting a previous experience with an unnamed substance that led to uncontrollable laughter and vivid hallucinations involving their keyboard transforming into a colorful landscape. This initial encounter left them eager for another similar experience but was followed by several less intense sessions.

On this particular occasion, the participant smoked marijuana before using the substance again. They experienced moderate effects initially but decided to take a larger dose after expressing a desire for a more profound experience. The second dose triggered intense visual and auditory distortions, including an out-of-body sensation where they felt their role in the world had been completed.

The participant then perceived a summary of past lives playing fast-forward, followed by a sense of becoming part of a cosmic organism. They communicated with other cells within this organism without using language as they knew everything instinctively. However, panic set in when they realized they were trapped inside a cell and their human consciousness was dead.

This led to feelings of distress and sorrow for their family and friends. The participant then found themselves trapped in a spiraling pattern with a threatening voice asking if they were okay. They experienced physical sensations of decomposition before recognizing familiar shapes and returning to their room, questioning the reality of their experience.

The entire episode lasted approximately 5 minutes, during which the participant paced around the room, trying to process what had happened. Afterward, they smoked more marijuana with a friend and continued as if nothing unusual occurred, though the experience left them feeling changed on a deeper level."
530,85417,"The individual describes their experience in two sessions. In the first session, after inhaling the substance, they felt as though they were trying to break through a barrier but did not fully succeed. They experienced a dream-like quality for about 15-20 minutes before returning to normal consciousness.

In the second session, following another inhalation, the individual entered an otherworldly environment described as a rectangular room or hallway with a buzzing energy and a peculiar flatness despite being three-dimensional. The walls were composed of constantly moving lines of pure energy, resembling stripes on wallpaper interspersed with eye-like designs about the size of a half-dollar coin. These eyes moved along the crackling lines of energy.

A dimensional water fountain emerged from the wall, made up of the same flowing lines of energy. A woman dressed in 1940s attire and pushing a baby carriage appeared; both were constructed of these energy lines. The woman drank from the fountain, merging with the water which was also composed of the same lines.

The individual then noticed a button on the wall, shaped like a hockey puck, made of the same linear energy. They had thoughts about pressing it but decided against it due to previous experiences where pressing such buttons led to significant changes in reality.

As they focused on one of the moving eyes, they suddenly became aware of their physical hands and returned to normal consciousness after 20 minutes."
531,110710,"The participant began with small doses of an herbal substance and gradually increased the dosage over several sessions. At a low dose, they experienced visual distortions such as colors sliding off objects and checkerboard patterns on walls. As the dosage increased, more intense effects were reported, including fractal designs when closing eyes, melting or stretching visuals, and a gravitational pull sensation. The user also noted experiencing 'slicing' of body movements into fast photography-like freezes.

During these experiences, the participant maintained lucidity and was able to shift perceptions by making conscious choices. For example, they transformed an ominous blanket into a warm, sunny day with flowers. They reported feeling mentally tired and slightly seasick after the sessions."
532,73474,"The participant took an unspecified substance in a large dose and began to experience intense effects almost immediately after inhalation. Initially, they noticed their vision vibrating and then saw visuals for the first time during this trip. They looked at themselves on a webcam and felt discomfort, which was alleviated by following an outside voice's instructions.

During the trip, the participant perceived that external forces were controlling their life and experiences. They broke free from these controls and left what they considered to be the ""set"" of their room. The entities around them opened doors in the walls to place items into the set or remove them without noticing the participant's presence.

The participant saw children's books with references to the entities, which were previously unnoticed. As the trip progressed, the earlier parts became hazy, and they found themselves in a strange world where physical limits did not exist. They became violent and unwilling to follow the voice's instructions to ""go with it.""

After struggling, the participant was pulled back through an archway into their room, feeling extremely light-headed and confused. They instinctively lay down on the bed and petted their dog, trying to ground themselves in reality. Upon seeing the substance vial, memories of the real world returned.

The trip lasted approximately three minutes before the effects began to wear off, similar to previous experiences with discomfort that resolved within 30 minutes."
533,110188,"The participant began their journey at a local park late one night, laying down on a blanket next to a friend (referred to as 'A'). After inhaling the substance, they experienced a familiar ""tug"" sensation and then saw a shooting star. This was followed by entering a forest filled with beautiful flowers.

From there, the participant walked into a clearing where they encountered a group of people dressed in ceremonial garb dancing around an ancient Mesoamerican pyramid. The participants felt as if this ceremony was specifically for their arrival. Two women greeted them warmly and placed a crown of flowers on their head before guiding them towards the pyramid.

Inside the pyramid, the participant met two elderly individuals who seemed to have an ancient wisdom. One of them put his hand on the participant's shoulder and then walked away, while the other woman explained that they had been waiting for the participant's return. The room contained a carved stone picture depicting a ceremonial scene with six men and six women in prayer-like poses.

The woman pointed out the picture and embraced the participant lovingly before the ground beneath them sank into the pyramid. After emerging from another part of the pyramid, the participant felt joyful and at peace, weeping with happiness upon returning to their original location.

During this experience, the participant recognized 'A' in one of the figures depicted in the carved stone picture. The trip concluded with the realization that an entity they had encountered during a previous trip was present, as well as the recognition of time travel through a pyramid similar to the one experienced."
534,85530,"In the initial two sessions, the participant experienced mild effects of Salvia. During the first session, they felt a prickling sensation on their face and a slight counter-clockwise twisting sensation. They associated this experience with colors similar to those from past mescaline use. The visual effect was minimal when eyes were closed.

The second session involved stronger effects. Upon inhalation, child-like chanting voices emerged, guiding the participant to a school. Closing their eyes revealed a three-by-three grid filled with counter-clockwise spirals that expanded to six-by-six upon reopening and reclosing them. A pleasant afterglow lasted several days following this experience.

In the third session, the effects were more intense due to a higher dosage and different conditions. The participant heard mischievous elf-like voices telling them they would be taken away forever from everyone they loved. This led to fear and panic as they tried to escape but were restrained by their sitter. Visuals included furniture and walls appearing like flat stage props sliding apart, reminiscent of ""The Flintstones."" After about twenty minutes, the experience faded, leaving a strong sense of well-being and insights into themselves."
535,69826,"The participant smoked a substance and felt themselves being pulled out of ordinary space-time, experiencing severe perceptual distortions. They described feeling stretched into infinity with colors appearing as separate strands of rubber. Their friend was also affected but to a lesser extent and encouraged them to let go. The participant struggled against the sensation and had difficulty recognizing their friend's identity during the experience.

After the effects subsided, the participant felt uncertain about whether they were still under the influence or if reality was an hallucination. They questioned the solidity of objects like cars and became acutely aware of sensory perceptions, distinguishing between tactile sensations and visual representations. The experience left them with a heightened awareness of subjectivity and arbitrariness in perception."
536,70149,"The participant experienced a series of effects from the substance, starting with small doses that induced sensations of vertigo and heaviness, similar to riding a tilt-a-whirl. With larger doses, they felt fractal-like folding and unfolding of their body and surroundings in time with music. This was accompanied by strong gravity-oriented feelings.

In another experience, space curved inward at multiple points around the field of vision, creating an intense pulling sensation from front to back and down. The participant described it as being pulled into a strange place behind them where they would be alone. They also experienced reality flattening out like a round piece of paper, with their head hanging off the edge.

During another session, while watching fractal mandala images, the participant felt a pulling sensation towards the center of the image and folding motions through the top of their mouth. This was described as an invitation to let go and come through, but they realized it was just an image on a screen.

In a final experience without visual aids, the participant experienced vertigo and complex fractal patterns when closing their eyes. The substance strongly affected their perceptions and logic ability during these experiences, leading to dream-like associations and sensations of flowing space."
537,70688,"The participant had their first experience with Salvia, starting with a lower dose that produced a sense of serenity without significant effects. They then tried a higher dose, which led to intense visual hallucinations. The visuals were described as indescribable and constantly changing images on what appeared to be a dissolving screen. During this state, the participant perceived others around them but could not see clearly. They felt embarrassed and trapped in an unfamiliar place for an extended period.

The sitter attempted to comfort the participant by saying ""It's ok, relax"" and beckoning them to come with him. The participant tried to stand up twice during the experience, pushing the couch out of position on the first attempt and nearly falling onto the coffee table on the second. They ended up sitting on the sitter's lap with their arms extended in front of them.

After the experience, the participant was sweating profusely and felt scared, despite laughing outwardly. The entire episode lasted only a few minutes but left the participant feeling overwhelmed and afraid to try Salvia again due to the intensity of the experience."
538,92237,"The participant begins their experience by inhaling a substance and lying down in a dark room. They report seeing stars reminiscent of Van Gogh's Starry Night filling up their room, along with playful imagery of objects floating as if in zero gravity. A being appears and seems to invite the participant into another realm without speaking.

In a subsequent attempt, the participant takes a larger dose and experiences a profound journey where they perceive themselves 'dying' and seeing their life represented as an infinitely small dot connected by a string to a larger dot representing a universe or collective consciousness. This string is part of a larger structure resembling musical strings being plucked by an unseen force.

The participant then sees a boy, similar to themselves as a child, playing with these strings without learning from a teacher figure. The experience ends abruptly back in reality, leaving the participant with awe and reflection on their insignificance compared to the vastness of existence but also the presence of something caring deeply about them."
539,92665,"The participant consumed a high-strength extract and immediately felt intense effects. Their body began to melt into the bench they were sitting on, eventually becoming part of it. They then fell through a gate-like structure into a two-dimensional space before returning to reality briefly. Upon re-entering the altered state, they found themselves in a 3D plane made up of blocks or legos. Here, they encountered multiple humanoid entities composed of small yellow blocks with black feathers on their heads and axes in their hands, resembling Native American warriors. These entities were engaged in flattening ground using intricate machines. The participant felt unwelcome and was eventually pulled back to reality by an unknown force. Upon returning, they experienced strong aftereffects including sweating and prickling sensations but felt a sense of accomplishment for having seen these entities."
540,69496,"The participant, a 31-year-old pharmacist, experienced an intense psychedelic trip using an unnamed substance. The experience began with a strong sensation of being pulled backward rapidly, followed by the disappearance of their bedroom. They found themselves floating in absolute blackness above infinite pages turning extremely quickly, each page representing different universes or times. A calm, deep voice told them that this was their current existence and that reality was a lie.

The participant felt overwhelming terror and wished for death. However, upon realizing they were already dead, the fear subsided slightly. They focused on slowing down the pages of time and eventually managed to grab onto one page containing an image of their wife. By holding onto her waist, the participant pulled themselves back into reality, falling backward onto the floor in their bedroom.

The experience was frightening but not considered a bad trip by the participant. They felt they had received everything they wanted during the experience and planned to use the substance again in the future."
541,83343,"A 26-year-old female experienced an intense psychedelic trip after consuming a small dose of a psychoactive substance. Initially, she noticed unusual smells and tastes before golden speckles appeared in her vision. As the effects intensified, reality seemed to shift dramatically. The room transformed into a three-dimensional paisley pod with swirling light and dark vortexes on either side.

The user perceived childlike voices belonging to small toad-like imps that guided her towards a tunnel leading to an amphibious realm. She felt pulled by these entities but struggled against the force, questioning their presence and origin. The environment around her became layered, with objects appearing both 2D and 3D simultaneously.

After about ten minutes, the effects began to subside, and she returned to normal reality. She called a friend to share her experience, feeling both wise and childlike afterward."
542,73347,"The individual began feeling effects shortly after inhaling a moderate-sized dose of an unnamed substance. Initially, they experienced a sensation of their body sinking and becoming disconnected from their mind. They felt as if their right side was being torn away and that there was a deity-like force controlling them. The participant became extremely distressed, yelling at their friend to stop ""fucking with"" them.

Physical sensations included the face feeling like it was being torn apart, numbness on the right side of the body, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing. They felt as if they were in a state of surgery without anesthesia and woke up mid-procedure, experiencing everything intensely. The experience lasted approximately five minutes but felt much longer.

The participant prayed for relief and asked their friend for help multiple times. After focusing on their breathing and sitting with closed eyes, the effects began to subside. They felt physically and emotionally drained afterward, as if they had run a marathon. For about 30 minutes post-experience, they struggled to think clearly and felt awkward around their friend."
543,68855,"During the first session, the participant experienced a visual hallucination of a miniature figure turning a lever in their right eye's vision, causing it to become two-dimensional and fall backwards like a drawbridge. This was followed by another hallucination where the participant felt as if they were sinking into a pit while observing a being with a bald head. The experience concluded with an invisible menthol-like current flowing over them.

In the second session, the participant had a more intense experience, feeling as though they were being suffocated and pulled into a colorful, mud-like environment. They perceived a presence trying to hide their body in this psychedelic space and screamed for help before panicking and spinning uncontrollably. Upon regaining normalcy, they found themselves on the opposite side of the room without recalling how they got there.

One month later, during another session, the participant experienced deja vu and entered a cement-like room where two voices were chatting casually. The walls began to crinkle like an accordion, and the participant felt as though they were being folded into this closing space, suffocating them. They struggled against what felt like a constricting shadow demon until halfway back in reality. Afterward, they were drenched in sweat and experienced insomnia for a week."
544,83095,"The participant smoked a strong dose of Salvia and immediately felt disconnected from reality, unsure of their identity or surroundings. They experienced intense physical and spiritual pain as if being torn apart by cylindrical, multi-colored objects. This was accompanied by a sense of falling into an infinite space and disorientation in geometric dimensions. The participant heard someone calling them back while their mother's voice was crying for them on the other side of a void. Childhood memories flashed through their mind, adding to the distress. They struggled to regain control, experiencing difficulty standing up and maintaining self-awareness. The room smelled and tasted unpleasant, and they feared having screamed loudly during the experience. After about 15 minutes, things gradually returned to normal."
545,91103,"An 18-year-old male experienced an intense trip after consuming a psychoactive substance. He felt a rapid loss of control and separation from his body, accompanied by warm sensations and distorted vision. His field of view became geometrically contorted, showing the forest clearing around him in an angular form.

The participant perceived voices or pervasive knowledge entering his being from something higher, suggesting that everything including himself was part of a phase of reality about to shift. He felt anger and struggled to prevent this shift, believing he could coerce whatever was facilitating it to allow the current phase to continue.

Gradually, he regained awareness of his surroundings but still felt disconnected from his body. His friends were around him, talking, though he initially couldn't communicate clearly. The experience lasted approximately 25 minutes, although it seemed much longer due to altered perception of time.

During the trip, the participant stood up and approached each person at some point, even attempting to grab a friend's ear through his beanie. He described feeling like a zombie or robot during these moments.

Afterwards, he felt that reality might not always be what is commonly perceived and questioned whether phase shifts occur regularly without awareness."
546,65520,"The participant prepared for their experience in a quiet room, meditating before consuming the substance. After inhaling it, they immediately felt a pulling sensation on their skin and experienced visual distortions such as shrinking or growing surroundings. The first experience ended after about five minutes.

On the second occasion, the effects were more intense. They lost track of time and space, feeling surrounded by repeating patterns of faces. This disorientation led to panic but was alleviated when they entered a friend's room across the hall. There, they experienced extreme time dilation and felt as though years had passed while in this altered state.

The participant then perceived themselves moving through space toward a distant light source, experiencing stages of fear, realization, and acceptance. They eventually returned to their physical surroundings, finding that some time had elapsed and noticing physical evidence of their actions during the experience, such as water on the carpet and an electrical outlet issue.

Overall, the experience lasted approximately twenty minutes and left the participant with a profound impression of having undergone an intense emotional journey."
547,88119,"The individual was alone in their dorm room when they decided to use a substance for the third time. Previous experiences were manageable and mostly pleasant, with visual sensations such as everything appearing cartoony and colorful. This time, the dose was higher than before. After inhaling the entire contents of the bowl, the participant felt an immediate shift into another reality.

In this new state, objects like the bowl in their hand took on significant meaning, though the individual did not fully comprehend it due to disorientation. They experienced a sense of being part of and inseparable from the realm they were in. The experience included repetitive motions with their arm, each repetition leading to morphing into another dimension within the previous one.

A presence was felt during this process, which the participant interpreted as understanding the unique personality or spirit associated with the substance. This led to fear that they would never return to their original reality and a struggle to regain normalcy. The individual attempted to reassure themselves by looking at contacts on their phone but began coming back to reality.

Even after the peak effects subsided, there were lingering sensations of other dimensions existing beyond the immediate environment. These included a sense of broadened consciousness and awareness extending beyond physical boundaries."
548,76137,"The individual experienced a substance-induced altered state characterized by intense sensory perceptions and emotional shifts. The first few minutes were marked by extreme panic followed by a sense of neutrality and detachment from self. During this period, they perceived time as static and felt interconnected with others through abstract anchor points represented visually as melting layers of colors and sounds.

After the initial wave, there was a brief moment of clarity where the participant asked for warmth and then entered a milder state that allowed some control over their experience, similar to meditation. They reported seeing themselves from above in a translucent room and felt an overwhelming respect for nature, particularly plants.

The account mentions memory gaps, one of which may have been intentionally suppressed due to its intensity or perceived impact on reality. The participant also interacted with another person (Digi) who provided support by covering them with a blanket when they were cold.

Overall, the experience was described as highly personal and emotionally complex, leading to changes in perspective regarding life and nature even after 24 hours."
549,67951,"The participant experienced two drug trips on different occasions. During the first trip, they saw large faces opening their mouths to reveal an abyss, which later transformed into a ceiling fan with similar visual characteristics. They heard repetitive audio of someone saying ""I can't find the password."" The sitter observed them and interacted briefly, leading to laughter over perceived humor in the room.

Between trips, the participant's sitter also took the drug, experiencing time dissociation similarly. For the second trip, which was more potent, they saw kaleidoscopic faces that evolved into a large plane of changing images resembling pin art. This included a detailed smiling female face and waves revealing grayscale faces on the other side. The visuals then shifted to an overhead view of parallel pillars made up of fractal faces.

The participant interacted with their sitter during this trip, describing the intensity and imagery to them. There were no significant audio hallucinations in the second trip, but there was a feeling of pressure in the ears and a steady deep background noise. The main part of the trip lasted about fifteen minutes, followed by a euphoric comedown."
550,68803,"The participant and a friend initially used an unnamed substance in two sessions. In the first session, they each took a small dose, which caused an increased heart rate and mild effects such as feeling slightly weird. They then doubled the dosage, leading to more pronounced hallucinations and physical sensations. The participant experienced uncontrollable laughter, felt part of a rotating 3D world while lying on a couch, and had complex multi-colored hallucinations. Walking around amplified these effects.

In the second session, the participant combined the substance with cannabis and took a slightly larger dose than before. They lay down on their bed and felt deeply relaxed, experiencing intense bodily sensations and elaborate dream-like journeys through space and time when closing their eyes. Hallucinations included misty white lines lifting them upwards, traveling through colorful tunnels towards a black hole, and seeing the laptop as a sound source emanating colors in sync with music.

The participant found darkness comforting and enjoyed dancing to music while on the trip. They could consciously prolong the experience by closing their eyes tighter when feeling it fade. The session lasted longer than expected, possibly due to the cannabis. Negative aspects included slight paranoia about visitors and being touched or distracted during closed-eye experiences."
551,78907,"The participant consumed dried leaves of a certain plant using the traditional Mazatec method in two separate attempts. In both instances, they experienced an altered state of consciousness characterized by detachment from their body and a perception that inner and outer worlds were one whole. They felt aware of awareness without form and described a sense of emptiness and freedom. The participant reported no concepts but noted the presence of different laws. They perceived themselves as limitless and capable of anything, with a feeling of infinity and lack of desires. Movement was unpleasant, and there was a need for stillness and silence to maintain this state. Visuals were faint, and they experienced smooth hand movements that seemed to come from outside their control. There was also a sensation of sexual arousal described as distant and somewhat alien. The participant felt conveyed a message about enjoying bliss without guilt or restrictions."
552,72338,"The participant prepared for their experience by setting up a comfortable environment in their bedroom, including tying themselves to the bed to ensure safety during the peak effects. They smoked an unknown substance through a water bong twice, experiencing immediate and intense effects after the second dose.

During the peak of the experience, the participant reported tunnel vision and fracturing reality with dark linear folds. The music played became more beautiful and enhanced their experience. They perceived green, eye-covered arms pulling them into another dimension, which they believed to be spirits associated with the substance. These spirits were described as playful and unthreatening but determined in their pull.

The participant's right side of the body tingled pleasurably while the left remained normal, creating a sense that only half of their body was in this other dimension. They communicated with these entities, asking for more intense sensations and offering their cheek to be pulled by them. The spirits were described as having a translucent body and forming a loop-like structure.

A fuzzy green spirit appeared from the participant's peripheral vision, which they believed to be the spirit of another substance (San Pedro). This entity studied the participant curiously before becoming friendly. With closed eyes, the participant saw dark 3D scenes made up of snaking tubes shooting past each other.

The most powerful aspect of the hallucinations was the belief that these spirits were real and present in their experience. The peak lasted for approximately ten minutes according to the participant's estimation. As the effects began to fade, the participant felt mild euphoria before returning to a more normal state of consciousness.

The entire experience lasted about 50 minutes, with the bulk of the intense effects lasting around half an hour."
553,79943,"The participant began their experience in a dimly lit room with their girlfriend Jodie. Initially, they felt detached from reality and saw glowing embers transform into a fire on a beach. They then experienced a sensation of a rake being dragged through their aura, causing pressure to build around their chest before releasing energy upwards towards the third eye.

The participant reported leaving their body and entering an alternate reality, visualizing the room as a fractal energy lattice. They interacted with this environment by manipulating energies in the air but remained close to their physical form due to fear of straying too far. Throughout the experience, they perceived Jodie as distant, which caused concern.

External voices were heard during the trip, described as mischievous whispers or pixies calling out. These voices seemed to encourage the participant to leave their body further. The experience lasted for an extended period before fading, and the participants returned to normal consciousness next to Jodie."
554,75874,"The participant began the experience by smoking a substance through a pipe, which caused immediate physical sensations of paralysis in their limbs. Their vision started to blur, initially showing digital patterns that extended from one eye to the other side of their field of view. As the effects intensified, they lost most of their vision and heard static-like sounds.

In this altered state, the participant perceived reality as torn apart, with a sense of having entered a featureless world. They felt panic and grief, attempting to cling to what remained of their perception of reality. The individual was seen crawling towards an object (a book-bag) while making distressed noises described as shrieks.

After a few minutes, the participant's vision returned, and they expressed confusion and distress about the experience. They attempted to describe what had happened to their roommate but were unable to fully convey the intensity of the hallucinations and emotions experienced during the trip."
555,66897,"The narrator and a group of friends, including some strangers they met, were camping by a lake and decided to use a substance together under the stars. After consuming the substance, each person experienced varying degrees of disorientation and incoherence. The narrator, who took a larger dose than intended, had an intense experience characterized by a feeling of falling backward out of reality.

During this state, the narrator perceived entities that acknowledged them and felt a sense of recognition similar to looking at oneself in a mirror. They saw endless branches and arching lines stretching beyond their vision. The narrator then experienced a sensation of being pulled into one of these branches, where they encountered a succession of themselves screaming. This was followed by another intense experience where the world tilted sideways, and their vision smeared outwards rapidly.

The narrator felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness and detachment from reality during this phase. They were eventually drawn back towards the beach, experiencing a reversal of the outward motion at high speed. Upon returning to reality, the narrator was incoherent and babbling, sitting oddly with knees bent and feet behind them. Friends around them expressed concern as the narrator's behavior became frantic and disturbed.

The experience lasted approximately three and a half minutes but felt much longer. Afterward, the narrator had difficulty maintaining their perception of reality without conscious effort for several more minutes."
556,68436,"The individual begins by smoking a small bowl of Salvia divinorum, packed well in a cheap bubbler. Initially, they feel a hollow sensation in their head and notice open-eye visuals resembling colorful logos. As the trip progresses, they become aware of an unfamiliar yet familiar presence behind them, which evokes profound confusion about existence and purpose.

The participant feels glued to their chair during this period and experiences difficulty moving or focusing thoughts. They attempt to prolong the experience by smoking another bowl but find it fades quickly. After standing up, they feel a need to hide the bong due to paranoia. The trip gradually subsides over 15 minutes, with the individual feeling increasingly in control as time passes.

Upon returning to normalcy, the participant reflects on the unique nature of the experience and expresses a desire to try it again, aiming for a deeper understanding next time."
557,88082,"Four individuals gathered in a field at night for a spiritual journey using an unidentified plant substance. After consuming the substance through smoking, the narrator experienced intense visual distortions and a sense of losing physical boundaries. The visuals were colorful and pulsating, creating a tunnel-like effect as if receding into the distance. The narrator perceived other beings communicating with them in repetitive phrases, whose forms changed with each wave of energy.

The experience included a period where the narrator felt disconnected from their body, experiencing what they described as ""ego death."" They also noted feelings of dysphoria and slight discomfort due to the intensity of the visuals and loss of control. As the effects began to subside, the narrator noticed clouds in the sky that seemed to repeat across the visual field.

The group waited for all members to return to normal consciousness before departing the field."
558,82591,"The individual conducted nine back-to-back sessions, experiencing a range of intense effects. In the first session, reality felt torn apart, with faces attached to 'reality zippers' that unzipped and melted away. This was followed by a dark and sinister experience in the second session, characterized by disintegration sensations and visuals resembling pulsing internal organs.

The third session brought euphoria and a sense of mental clarity, where the participant felt they were floating in an ocean with waves gently lapping over them. The fourth session also featured euphoria but with more vivid visuals: purple and green cell-shaped entities extending pseudopodia to attach to shimmering white cubes.

From the fifth to seventh sessions, the individual encountered a dark-skinned Mayan woman who aged from young to old during these encounters. She communicated telepathically, starting as a vibrant young woman, then a strong middle-aged woman, and finally an elderly village wise-woman with deep wrinkles.

The eighth and ninth sessions were less intense, allowing for some lucidity where the participant could still pay attention to external sounds and think about trivial matters while in the trance state."
559,85209,"The participant prepared for their first experience by abstaining from other substances, eating raw food, and meditating. They inhaled an unnamed substance through a bong three times before achieving noticeable effects. After inhaling the third time, they experienced a tingling sensation in their face, hands, and feet, followed by visual patterns that took on a three-dimensional appearance.

The participant then perceived entities described as ""workers"" moving towards a light source, which they interpreted as a horizon. These workers were singing a simple melody in beautiful harmonies. The experience was described as safe and non-threatening, similar to a lucid dream. The trip lasted approximately 10-15 minutes, including the inhalations.

Upon coming down from the experience, the participant felt intense euphoria and remained in a good mood for the rest of the day."
560,66994,"The participant began their experience by inhaling an unknown substance through a water pipe. Immediately after, they lost all sense of self, location, and reality. They found themselves in a surreal environment consisting of interconnected cubes that moved monotonously through space. Each cube met another at its corners, creating the illusion of a continuous surface folded into itself like a Möbius strip.

During this experience, the participant was periodically pushed to the outside of these cubes, allowing them brief glimpses of an external force propelling the structure forward. These moments were particularly frightening as they felt exposed and vulnerable. The sensation of being squeezed through the folds between rooms was described as drowning in solid material with immense inward pressure distributed evenly across their body.

A repetitive multi-syllabic word or phrase echoed in the participant's mind, though its meaning is unclear. There was also a pervasive anti-nostalgic feeling that seemed to come from an unsettling distant past. The only moment of clarity came when the participant realized they were lying on the floor propped up on their forearms, gasping for air.

The experience ended as the participant regained some awareness and found themselves standing in their office, clutching a yoga mat. They then laid down on the couch to relax."
561,67495,"The individual experienced three sessions of drug use. In the first session, they smoked a small amount and began to feel effects at half a bowl. Visual distortions occurred, with objects changing colors and parallax scrolling. The participant felt as though they were on stage with an invisible audience and that their wife was in a digital world. The experience ended abruptly.

In the second session, visual distortions intensified. Objects shifted planes, and arm tracers appeared when moving the hand. The participant saw abstract imagery like snowy trees becoming organic structures and vaulting into space. They felt as though parts of their body had left behind remnants in the air. The trip concluded with billowing smoke from a print.

The third session was described as the most profound. After smoking three hits, the participant experienced vivid imagery where they became a sun god overseeing a farmer and his son in a cornfield. They felt pride and empathy for the humans' work and an unbroken chain of influence over future generations. The experience shifted to abstract visuals like clouds and a pulsating uterus before ending with the participant explaining their state to their wife."
562,85036,"The participant experienced an altered state of consciousness after ingesting a substance. They initially laughed uncontrollably before feeling as if reality was divided into rotating planes that caused them to twist their body in response. The corner where the car's door met the dashboard took on a significant personality, and they felt a sense of communication with it, though no words were exchanged. The experience included feelings of being a character in a story and seeing the world through new eyes. Upon coming down from the experience, they felt mentally refreshed, happy, and open to communicating their thoughts and childhood memories to their girlfriend."
563,63716,"The participant experienced a rapid journey beyond Earth's atmosphere and into an abstract realm where they observed what appeared to be all of mankind's reality encapsulated in an orb. They found themselves trapped inside a box with two children, presumably siblings, playing outside. The boy noticed the participant and expressed concern, urging his sister to ""put hers out,"" suggesting he was also holding onto another reality-orb. Both children seemed fearful and worried about being caught.

The girl approached the participant's location and gently pushed them back into their orb, attempting to return their consciousness to their body. The participant briefly resisted but was ultimately forced back into their bedroom. Upon returning, the effects of the substance quickly dissipated."
564,62779,"The individual reported feeling detached from the passage of time shortly after using an unspecified substance. They perceived that their heartbeat regulated the flow of time around them but felt themselves falling behind as this regulation weakened. In this state, they encountered entities referred to as 'regulators,' whose role was to ensure everything progressed through time.

These regulators were confused by the individual's presence outside of time and attempted to push them back into synchronization with the passage of time. The process involved multiple regulators guiding the person's limbs and thoughts across different dimensions. The participant could see their friends' worried expressions in slices of time where they were not present, but couldn't communicate directly.

The experience was emotionally intense for the individual, who broke down crying due to the overwhelming perception of their friends' fear. The regulators tried to comfort them, which helped alleviate some distress. Gradually, the participant regained momentum and was pushed back into synchronization with time. Upon returning, they were initially unsure if they had been placed in the correct moment but received assurances from those around them."
565,61551,"The participant began experimenting with an unnamed substance using sublingual ingestion methods at low doses. They experienced mild closed-eye visuals, a cessation of mental chatter, and enhanced eyesight. The second and third sessions showed similar effects but also included altered auditory perception, where traffic noise sounded like ambient music. 

After these initial experiences, the participant tried smoking the substance, starting with 1/4 gram which produced minor tingling sensations and closed-eye visuals. A subsequent attempt with a stronger extract (5x) resulted in a more intense experience. Upon inhaling this dose, the user immediately felt an overwhelming wave of effects. The world ceased to exist except for their fireplace, which displayed infinite regressing visual patterns.

During this experience, the participant encountered what they perceived as Lady Salvia, a female entity resembling a woman's face carved into the mantle. This encounter was described as joyous and playful but also overwhelming. Gradually, the user regained awareness of self and reality through small holes in their field of vision, eventually returning to normal perception.

The experience concluded with the participant expressing amazement at the intensity of the effects from a small dose and an intention to explore further with adjusted dosages."
566,69995,"The participant prepared for their experience by thoroughly cleaning their living space and setting up a comfortable environment with natural light. They smoked marijuana before the trip to relax and watched The Simpsons on television. After consuming the substance, they experienced an intense body high and visual distortions during the opening stage. In the descent stage, they felt overwhelmed as their vision became disjointed and cartoon-like images mocked them.

During the emergence stage, the participant had what they described as an out-of-body experience, observing themselves from afar while feeling detached and floating in a black void. They could see and feel their physical body moving around but were unable to control it directly. Cartoon characters from The Simpsons appeared on the TV, including Marge Simpson who became frustrated with the participant's lack of attention.

The encounter stage involved an unnamed entity described as having a birdlike head and human body named Eros. This entity imparted feelings of relaxation and self-validation telepathically. In the insight stage, the participant engaged in a conversation with Marge Simpson about their thoughts on drugs and drug use, discussing personal choices and the potential benefits of certain substances.

The return stage saw the participant reorienting themselves back to their original position on the couch as the effects began to wear off. They experienced a euphoric ""glow"" during the come-down phase, feeling clear-headed and reflective about the experience."
567,56531,"The individual began their experience by smoking a substance in a controlled environment. They reported feeling disconnected from their body and surroundings almost immediately after inhaling. Their visual perception was dominated by four primary colors: red, green, yellow, and white, with occasional blue. The participant felt as though they were part of an infinite universe, where every molecule of their body represented a unique version of themselves.

As the experience progressed, the individual's thoughts became more abstract, leading to the realization that existence might be meaningless and that humans are merely cogs in a larger entity. This led to a visual representation where the participant saw themselves as part of an intricate machine, with each component representing smaller versions of themselves. The participant attempted to communicate this realization but felt trapped in an infinite loop, unable to convey their thoughts.

The experience began to fade after about 15-20 minutes, and the individual regained some awareness of their surroundings. They noticed that they had moved a bong from its original position without consciously remembering doing so. Upon returning to normalcy, the participant interacted with others in an apartment complex, where their behavior was somewhat erratic due to residual effects.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling strange but not unpleasant and smoking marijuana to calm themselves down."
568,56670,"The participant began by inhaling smoke from a homemade bong filled with the substance. Initially, they noticed slight visual distortions in the carpet, which appeared to flicker like flames. They felt gravity shift slightly to their right side. The participant then experienced an entity emerging from the carpet pattern: an ancient turtle-like drawing that moved slowly towards them. This encounter was perceived as normal and unremarkable.

The participant heard themselves repeating ""They are us"" in their own voice, which continued until they repeated it several times aloud. They reflected on why they were alive, contemplating past events and feelings of interconnectedness with others. A forgotten childhood memory surfaced during this introspection, involving a prayer for the well-being of others at the expense of personal happiness.

Perception of reality gradually returned after some time, though the participant's memory was fragmented initially."
569,77006,"The participant experienced three sessions with an unnamed substance. In the first session alone at night, they saw a whirlwind of cobras and felt intense energy while sitting in the lotus position. They closed their eyes and drifted into obscurity, feeling detached from friends.

In the second session outdoors with a friend, visual patterns resembling sausages appeared. The participant felt as if they were in another dimension and communicated this to their friend, emphasizing the separation between them. As time passed, they slowly returned to normal spatial and temporal awareness.

During the third attempt, mice appeared visually when eyes were closed. By focusing on energy, the participant entered a space-like environment with rotating spheres, feeling disconnected from reality."
570,66967,"The participant embarked on a 7-day retreat in a small cabin to meditate and use an unnamed substance for introspection. On day two, they experienced intense visual hallucinations after using the substance. They saw a tall, gaunt child-like figure with grey hair and dress, pushing a stroller that morphed into a bus filled with shadowy figures. The participant felt trapped and helpless on this bus as it soared over desolate landscapes.

On subsequent days, the participant continued to use the substance, experiencing various hallucinations including black-feathered entities and crowded rooms of whispering voices. They also attempted to meditate for extended periods but struggled with physical discomfort and fatigue from fasting.

On day six, they ingested mushrooms along with the unnamed substance. This led to intense stomach cramps and a vivid hallucination where the cabin transformed into an opulent castle filled with shimmering light. The participant saw a woman frantically collecting glass pieces representing moments in time. They also encountered a figure resembling their father who advised them that ""golf is life"" and reassured them, ""You are not responsible.""

The experience concluded with a renewed sense of purpose but also the realization of the world's indifference. The participant left the retreat early on day seven feeling content despite ongoing physical discomfort."
571,54513,"The participant began their experience with a single inhalation from a pipe filled with leaves of an unspecified substance. They immediately felt a humming buzz at the edges of their visual field, followed by a dissolution of ego and human form both physically and cognitively. The effects were warm and without fear or discomfort.

After the initial wave subsided, they inhaled again, experiencing auditory hallucinations and perceiving the world as a two-dimensional collage with visible cracks where light shone through. They felt an uncomfortable wrenching sensation as if being spun on an infinitely large wheel, accompanied by a loathing for physicality but still clinging to their personality.

The participant saw a representation of human consciousness as a holographic master plate and perceived humanity's aggressive ignorance as repulsive. Four giant arms spinning beneath this image tore it apart into tattered flags with drawings of the world, revealing a void of white light behind them. There was a repeating sense of infinity where time seemed meaningless.

A series of words, particularly one significant phrase, danced elusively around their perception, whispering in colors rather than sounds. As the experience concluded, they felt an immediate disconnection from their physical body and returned to normal thought as if covering up previous paths. The participant reported feeling peaceful and happy for hours afterward with no negative side effects."
572,71099,"The participant prepared an Ayahuasca brew using Mimosa Hostilis rootbark and Peganum harmala seeds in a vacant house. They consumed approximately one-third of the brew at 9:10 PM, experiencing mild closed-eye visuals shortly thereafter. At around 9:30 PM, they noticed more vivid visual hallucinations, including insect-like eyes that coalesced into a feminine grasshopperlike creature. This entity advised against listening to music and provided an experience of pulsating lever-button things.

Sinister entities then entered the participant's consciousness, one appearing as blueish spaceship-zeppelin shapes with weasel snouts. The participant experienced nausea and purged outside on the porch. Upon returning inside, they encountered a series of singing cave-room beings made from plastic-like ribbons or air interlaced with transparent rainbows. These entities sang in clouds and images.

The participant also experienced a state where every part of their body glowed with warm blue light before going numb. They had difficulty recognizing themselves but did not panic about potential physical harm. Later, they spoke to their girlfriend on the phone at around 12:58 AM, discussing the remaining duration of the experience and confessing wrongs.

Visual hallucinations continued during this period, including a spiderweb of melting flowers and a diamond-shaped plastic object with balls whizzing through holes. The participant gradually returned to reality by 1:40 AM but remained altered for another two hours before falling asleep. The next day, they felt energetic and optimistic, deciding to enroll in school full-time."
573,71687,"The participant began by smoking a full bowl of a substance they had limited previous exposure to, leading to immediate effects. They felt as if the universe was being ripped in multiple directions and became disoriented from their surroundings. Their friends reported that he fell into a sliding glass door before exclaiming about a monkey stealing his backpack and then sprinted outside.

The participant described an experience of existing in a place made entirely of light, where everything coexisted harmoniously. They felt like a vital part of a larger system and believed they had returned home to a place where everyone was present. Entities communicated with the participant, telling them that this was their day to experience heaven and advising them to pursue music because people would listen when he played piano.

As the effects began to wear off, the participant became aware of returning to reality. The entities guided him through reacclimating to three-dimensional space, explaining concepts like distance, time, solid objects, and language. They also demonstrated that they were still present even when out of sight by inhabiting nearby forms.

The participant expressed a desire to stay in this altered state but was pulled back into reality. Upon returning, he sought comfort under a blanket for an hour, hoping either to return or to become sober again due to the intense feelings left behind. The experience had lasting effects on his perception and interactions with the world around him, including increased awareness of entities and a heightened sense of connection to everything."
574,61537,"The participant was in a tent with two friends when they experienced visual and sensory distortions after consuming an unspecified drug. They felt drawn to a corner of the tent where they perceived a warm presence holding them upright. The experience then shifted into what seemed like an alternate reality, characterized by slowed time perception and distorted visuals. In this state, their friends appeared as multiple repetitions in a green and purple tunnel, with piercing eyes that made the participant feel helpless and exposed. They attempted to return to reality by recognizing their friends but felt irritable upon exiting the tent. The effects lasted up to 12 hours, during which they experienced erratic sleeping patterns and altered perceptions of reality."
575,61949,"The participant inhaled a high dose of an extract and experienced rapid transitions between different perceptual states. Initially, they felt intense pressure on their legs and chest, followed by a black-out period. Upon regaining consciousness, the participant perceived themselves surrounded by a giant void with a tiny box of color moving away from them. This was succeeded by horizontal pillars of light flashing across their vision.

Inside each pillar, the participant experienced different worlds. In one world, they encountered grey aliens experimenting on them, which felt terrifying and lasted an extended period. Another frame showed stars or fuzzy TV signals, followed by a scene where familiar faces were laughing at them from thrones, creating feelings of embarrassment and fear. The next frame depicted torture by familiar figures using knives and saws, causing intense emotional distress.

The final pillar brought the sensation that reality was a trick played on them, with everyone in on it, leading to profound confusion and sadness. As the experience ended, the participant regained clarity but remained disoriented, questioning why they were not back home. They eventually stood up, still feeling shock from the intensity of the trip."
576,16937,"The participant consumed DXM and experienced visual distortions and nausea before smoking salvia. Upon consuming salvia, they entered an intense hallucinatory state where reality appeared as a ""plastic factory"" with people falling in a domino-like pattern. They saw a woman's face connected to a plastic band on the duvet cover, which seemed hostile towards them. The experience lasted only a few minutes but was described as one of the most bizarre and intense experiences of their life."
577,58198,"The individual begins by inhaling smoke from a bong, leading to an altered state of consciousness. They see creatures from ""Where the Wild Things Are"" dancing around a fire in a red forest background, which morphs into various patterns and colors reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. The experience transitions to a view from their window, where they notice a stone tower with flickering light. This tower has eyes that seem to communicate with the individual, questioning if they remember taking a drug.

The individual feels disconnected from their body and experiences confusion about their identity and surroundings. They imagine being part of a Soviet plot and having memories implanted by an adoptive mother or nurse. The room appears brightly lit, and they see friends B and D instead of imagined family members. The eyes on the tower continue to mesmerize them, and the individual hears repetitive music that enhances the feeling of being in a game show.

The experience includes seeing fractal bubbles around the eyes, which become translucent, revealing the actual room. The individual has moments of insight about their life but feels disconnected from their body and awkward in communication with others. After about 30 minutes, they return to normalcy, though still feeling slightly weird and playful for some time."
578,56099,"The individual and five friends gathered in a park to smoke an extract of a hallucinogenic substance. They began by meditating to relax before smoking. After several tokes from a bong, the individual felt a sleepy buzz settle over them. Their vision split into thirds, with one portion dominating their focus while the others were dimmer and skewed.

The individual then experienced visual hallucinations where their right side of the body transformed into a vast mountain range extending into the distance. They felt awe and a sense of responsibility as if they were part of this landscape. After some time, reality returned, and the group continued to pass the bong around. One friend had an intense trip characterized by an expressionless face and drooling for several minutes before laughing.

Later that day, in a poolshed with one friend, the individual smoked again. Their vision split into thirds once more, but this time with scraggly black lines dividing them. They entered a dreamlike trance, feeling vegetative and unresponsive to their surroundings. After regaining consciousness, they moved to a more comfortable setting outside.

In the new location, after smoking again, the individual's right arm disappeared as if pushed away by an energy from the word ""thanks."" This felt odd but not painful or scary. The effects faded, leaving them with a buzz similar to marijuana."
579,53552,"The participant began by smoking an unknown substance in a dark room while listening to music. They reported feeling comfortable and slightly nervous but prepared for the experience through meditation. After inhaling deeply from the pipe, they entered a state of consciousness where everything felt like it was compressed into one singular moment. The participant questioned their identity and origin, realizing they had smoked something that brought them there.

In this altered state, the participant saw a tunnel flanked by columns of light and wondered about its source. They eventually recognized it as the peephole from which they checked for anyone outside before smoking. The experience was described as an absolute totality of existence with no awareness of anything beyond that moment.

The participant struggled to return to their original reality, feeling like they were peeling back layers in reality and pulling themselves onto ledges closer to the dimension they left behind. They eventually returned by turning on a lamp, which anchored them back to their familiar reality. The entire experience lasted approximately 23 minutes but felt eternal.

Upon returning, the participant could still feel the edges of reality trying to come apart and saw walls between dimensions attempting to crumble."
580,63874,"A person decided to try an unknown substance after hearing about it from a friend. They invited a friend over who had tried it before with minimal effects. The first attempt involved the friend taking one hit, which caused her to feel as if everything was splitting into pieces and that the narrator was just a layer of himself rather than his whole body. She left the room briefly but returned shortly after.

The narrator then took a hit and experienced being pulled down and to the right with extra sensitive skin pores. He burst into laughter and found he could only breathe while laughing. After returning to normal, they tried again, this time with more substance. The friend started laughing and then became scared, flapping her hands and asking to be made whole again.

The next day, both participants prepared a gravity bong in the narrator's bedroom with no visual stimulation. The narrator experienced an intense feeling of warmth and prickliness before diving into his trip. He felt like a minuscule person inside a tunnel that was both pitch black and neon rainbow at the same time. Talking pulled him out of the trance, but laughing allowed him to breathe again."
581,51862,"The individual began their experience in a darkened room with soft music playing. They started with a small dose, experiencing mild visual hallucinations of rectangular creatures and a black void for about 30 seconds to a minute. After two attempts, they took a larger dose, leading to a more intense experience.

In this state, the participant perceived themselves as part of a wooden structure, with sections of colorful veneers forming a red tunnel. They felt forces assembling them into a box-like shape and rising up through the tunnel. Outside the tunnel was a plain where children were playing; when they emerged, the children showed excitement but were pulled back by rollers.

The participant realized they were a children's toy, feeling their body as an assembled object rather than a traditional human form. This realization brought laughter and surprise at the illusion of existence. The experience lasted about 7 to 10 minutes before abruptly ending, leaving a sense of curiosity about what might have happened next."
582,46999,"The participant began their experience by inhaling an unknown substance through a pipe. Immediately after inhalation, they collapsed onto the bed next to their partner. They found themselves in a corridor made of coruscating orange and yellow energy, with no memory of their ordinary life or reality. The environment felt familiar and comforting.

As the experience progressed, entities appeared as invisible floating beings near head-height. These entities were described as jovial and kind, repeatedly saying ""Ok, let's scoop Moonshadow up"" in a cheerful tone. They helped the participant move to what seemed like a viewing box in a 19th-century French theatre, where there was an ongoing chaotic performance with many people entering and exiting the stage.

The participant then returned to their original corridor, noticing that a door made of energy was resolving into a more defined shape. This coincided with brief flashes of ordinary self-awareness becoming more stable. Eventually, they realized the ""door"" was actually a bookshelf in their bedroom and that they were lying across their partner's legs.

The effects lasted approximately 15 minutes from start to finish, with a very rapid onset and short duration. The participant experienced intense sweating during the experience but felt fine afterward."
583,48391,"The participant smoked an unspecified substance in extract form and quickly entered into a highly altered state of consciousness. They left their house barefoot in the rain and ran to a nearby hotel lobby where they screamed for help before running again. In this state, they believed that the world was ending and felt a force consuming parts of them. After returning home, they were reunited with their roommate and girlfriend, who helped them gradually return to reality over the next 20 minutes or so."
584,66185,"The participant began by chewing several leaves sublingually for twenty minutes with only mild swirling sensations. They then smoked three bowls of dried leaf, experiencing similar but slightly more intense effects. After returning to baseline, they used an enhanced extract and inhaled a substantial amount. This led to vivid visual distortions where everything appeared to be spinning violently. The participant entered a state of dissociated delirium, losing their sense of identity and questioning the nature of reality. They wondered if they were part of the room or just another object within it. After about five minutes, the participant regained some orientation but still felt dizzy for twenty more minutes. Overall, the experience was described as confusing rather than scary, with no lasting negative effects."
585,64498,"The experience began with the participant holding a tincture in their mouth, leading to intense psychological effects rather than warped reality. Panic set in, causing physical discomfort such as heart racing and fear of death. The environment felt crushing, and the participant laid down on the floor for comfort from a sitter.

Visualizations included images from House on the Rock and giant Hershy-kiss turbines processing substances. After the initial peak, the experience became calm and refreshing. Later, while smoking enhanced leaf with sitters, the participant drew a picture of a leaf/snail goddess and continued to have visionary experiences in bed.

These visions involved globules of faces morphing in liquid essence, cords or tentacles representing consciousness interactions, and a unifying cosmic body. The participant gained insights into relationships, PTSD, and personal growth. They felt ready to improve their relationships, especially with their son."
586,43760,"The participant began by using a small amount of the substance, experiencing mild effects including a strange pressure on their face and a lingering sense that something was off for about 45 minutes after the initial high wore off. In subsequent attempts with larger doses, they reported more intense experiences. During one session, they perceived space as undulating waves rising from dark vertical bands in their field of view. Reality fragmented into a grid-like structure, and their perception of time became distorted, feeling like overlapping intervals. They felt as though they were observing multiple parallel realities simultaneously and experienced difficulty communicating with their wife due to uncontrollable laughter. The participant returned to normal within an hour but found the experience highly unusual and thought-provoking."
587,60805,"The experience began in a quiet room during midday. After an initial unsuccessful attempt to ingest the substance sublingually, the individual smoked approximately 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of shredded or ground leaf through a water pipe. The effects were immediate, leading to a series of vivid and surreal visions.

In one vision, the participant observed strange ancient-Asian-styled buildings that opened into hallways adorned with mahogany, history, and hieroglyphics from various ages. These structures led to vast horizons and skies filled with an eternal light. The individual encountered a large dragon-like creature described as a ""steam roller dragon"" which appeared neutral in demeanor and was of divine design.

The participant then entered a forest-spirited environment featuring intricately styled tile surfaces reminiscent of Aztec or Amazonian designs. In this setting, they were shown a piece of advanced technology called Venus Wallum (the exact name is unclear) hidden underground in a hieroglyph-decorated storage room.

In the final stages of the experience, the participant found themselves on an animated planet with purple skies and bluish ground surfaces. They encountered a cave-like opening between the legs of a female figure and entered what appeared to be an intergalactic sex joint run by faeries. These faeries were described as having no obvious faces but human facial forms upon closer inspection, illuminated by vibrant lime-green light.

The participant engaged in various sexual encounters with these faeries, including the cave opening itself and booths that provided sexual gratification. The faeries were depicted as daughters of Mother Nature, not working for a club or business, but rather branches of a feminine force seeking to reproduce through male travelers.

The experience concluded with the individual waking up in their room, having been in a half-trance state during the latter part of the encounter."
588,64888,"The participant sat alone under a Japanese Maple tree on their back porch during a sunny day. They smoked the substance from a water pipe and immediately felt intense effects. A calm, soothing voice spoke to them telepathically, telling them to ""Enjoy your ride."" The visual experience was described as surroundings twisting and folding over like pages in a book, revealing glimpses of another reality within each fold. Auditory experiences included strange yet harmonious sounds, similar to cicadas forced into harmonic patterns.

The participant saw blobby, blurry beings reaching out with arms, calling them to join their reality. They felt torn between realities but remained mostly in the current one due to subconscious resistance and fear of losing grip on it. The experience was intense for about three minutes before they went inside to a darker area, where the effects calmed down.

Inside, the participant sat on the couch with closed eyes and experienced a scene that felt like a déjà vu. They then walked outside again but only felt unbalance and confusion. After lying down in bed, the haze lasted for several hours."
589,63538,"The participant smoked Salvia Divinorum extract using a water pipe and held the smoke for an extended period before exhaling. They experienced a rapid onset of effects and found themselves immersed in a world filled with living entities that taunted them, saying things like ""You're stuck here"" or ""This is the real world."" The user tried to prove they could leave this place but was confronted by more evidence supporting the entities' claims. Eventually, the participant reached a peak where they realized they had entered a hidden realm connected by a central deity. They then snapped back to reality, realizing they had taken Salvia and that their door was open, having been yelling at walls and out into the hallway during the experience."
590,62571,"The participant began by placing about 2-3 grams of dried leaves under their tongue for 20 minutes, experiencing mild body sensations and minor visual patterns with closed eyes. After rinsing their mouth with alcohol-containing mouthwash, they rehydrated a larger amount (approximately 3.5-4.5 grams) and chewed the leaves for about 5 minutes. They noticed definite effects at around 15 minutes, including closed-eye visuals that were similar to previous experiences but more concrete.

The participant saw fleeting glimpses of what they referred to as the ""salvia world,"" including a dog-like entity composed of cubic bands in various colors and tribal stone-carved faces. After about two minutes, the effects subsided and became gentler without ego loss. They then smoked a plain leaf cigarette prepared by their friend X, which intensified the experience.

Upon smoking, they experienced indescribable visions and entered what they described as a tunnel-like structure composed of compartments with different ""universes."" They felt depersonalized and detached from reality while moving through this tunnel. The experience gradually subsided after about an hour, allowing them to return to normal consciousness by 11 PM."
591,63461,"The participant began their experience in a dimly lit room with friends, where they smoked an extract of unknown potency. They experienced difficulty with short-term memory and had one fleeting open-eye hallucination early on. As the effects intensified, the participant saw the room start to split apart, perceiving everything as if it were part of a movie set. The environment appeared chaotic, with objects moving and changing shape.

The participant felt as though they were in an alternate reality where their previous life was revealed to be a sham created by some higher force. They encountered a calm, womanly presence that seemed to watch over them, reminiscent of an elementary school teacher. This presence did not communicate verbally but provided a sense of guidance and acceptance.

As the experience progressed, the participant attempted to navigate through this altered reality, encountering oversized objects and distorted scenes. They eventually reached a point where they accepted their new existence and tried to return to normalcy by approaching what appeared to be a door leading back to their original reality. Upon opening the door slightly, they saw a hallway and felt that returning was possible.

The participant's friends helped them reorient to the physical world, and as the effects wore off, they gradually regained awareness of their surroundings. They spent time reflecting on the experience, feeling grateful for the simple joys of existing in what they now perceived as a real world with other humans."
592,56819,"The participant had their first experience with an unnamed psychoactive substance at a friend's house. They initially felt a pricking sensation on their skin before lying down to observe a dark expanse with swirling bits of lighter black. After taking another hit, they became part of the border of this darkness and experienced it as more real and defined.

During this time, they had conversations with friends who were present but found it difficult to communicate clearly due to the intensity of their experience. They observed shapes moving along bright blue lines within the dark expanse before deciding to turn over to see something else. Upon turning over, all they saw was a static-like image on the ceiling.

After coming back somewhat from the intense visuals, the participant felt the need to drive home but experienced hallucinations during the journey. These included seeing friends with glowing eyes and an evil grin, feeling disassociated from themselves, and encountering a mysterious figure in another car who vanished suddenly."
593,58795,"The participant had three salvia experiences in one session. In the first experience, minor visual changes occurred, including living bedposts with faces and playful entities on a fabric framework. The second trip involved a stronger effect: the participant felt their body dissolve into green globules while laughing uncontrollably. They communicated with O, who found the experience amusing. In the third trip, the participant entered a garden-like setting with busy entities and experienced being inside a purse, moving through a cartoonish world of shoppers. The entities expressed sadness at the participant's departure. Throughout the experiences, the participant maintained communication with their sitter, O, who provided comfort and support."
594,48546,"The individual began by smoking a large amount of salvia after consuming marijuana. They reported feeling disoriented and experiencing visual changes immediately after inhaling the substance. As they continued to smoke, their perception altered significantly; they saw themselves in a TV reflection as an evil figure taking hits from a bong. The room appeared grey, and objects seemed to have personalities.

The participant attempted to leave the room but was hindered by animated objects on the floor that wanted entry into their realm. After falling back onto what felt like a different plane of existence, they experienced physical sensations such as gravity shifting and cutting their hand while spilling bong water. They then conversed with perceived entities, including a lighter and video game case, which took on human-like characteristics.

The experience included moments of intense laughter and confusion about reality. The participant eventually managed to lie down on the bed but continued to feel disoriented and speak in an unfamiliar language. They expressed regret for not having recorded the experience and emphasized the importance of having a sitter during such trips due to the intensity and unpredictability of the effects."
595,57495,"The individual began by feeling light-headed after ingesting an unknown substance. They perceived their room as expanding outward, causing initial panic but later calming down once they recognized what was happening. Physical sensations included a heavy, uncontrollable weight and intense warmth alternating with coldness. The participant felt as though they were moving through their own body, experiencing it from the inside out.

Visualizations included thick silvery pink liquid waves, a ship sailing on top of them, and eventually transitioning to being wind, grass, and revisiting childhood memories. They experienced a connection between all aspects of existence and felt grateful for this experience.

The participant then encountered an older gentleman with his daughter in what appeared to be New York during the 1930s. They briefly visited a food shop where they empathized with the owner's frustration. The individual then transitioned into being an upper-class person at a party, arguing with their wife and later experiencing a violent encounter that left them unconscious.

Subsequently, the participant became a dark-skinned drummer in a desert landscape, playing music with a friend named Hikim. They learned their name was Voodar-Sa-La and were asked about a woman they planned to marry. The experience concluded with floating outside of their body, feeling connected to a star, and receiving guidance from an unknown entity.

The participant felt uplifted for several days after the experience, reporting a greater sense of unity with the universe and understanding of non-human existence."
596,55296,"The individual began by smoking a small amount of extract through an ice-cooled water bong, experiencing mild effects that included serpentine shivers and vivid thoughts but nothing particularly remarkable. They then smoked another dose later in the evening after dinner with friends, this time feeling more pronounced effects almost immediately.

Upon inhaling the second dose, they felt as though their ego had been disconnected, losing all sense of self, body, and location. Visual perception was absent or not appreciated. A force field-like sensation pulled them towards their bed, where they remained semi-conscious but unable to control actions such as hiding the bong in a closet.

After about 20-25 minutes, the effects began to subside with the help of music and familiar sounds. The individual felt refreshed upon waking up after approximately 5.5 hours of sleep. They noted feeling stronger and equipped with new insights into their mind's fragility and the influence of external factors on thought patterns."
597,27573,"The individual began their experience by ingesting 3.5 ml of an undiluted liquid after lying in bed for about an hour. They felt a stinging sensation in their mouth before transitioning into the experience. The participant reported merging with a massive, ancient, and benign entity representing the night. This merging allowed them to become part of the ocean waves crashing on a nearby beach under a moonlit sky. During this state, they had a profound understanding that life and consciousness could be likened to bubbles in water, where the physical aspect (water) encases the spirit (air bubbles), creating life.

As the effects began to dissipate, the participant felt observed by alien entities older than the night entity. They attempted to stretch themselves away from their body, experiencing this as a physical sensation. The individual believed with practice they could access new experiences but were currently unprepared for them. As the experience concluded, everything in their life seemed to fall into place leading up to that moment. They became aware of an entity responsible for the experience itself, which had its own volition and wanted to be remembered."
598,58935,"The participant prepared for their experience by setting up a comfortable environment and using approximately 1/10 gram of '20x' Salvinorin-A-infused crushed Salvia leaf in a glass pipe. Upon inhalation, they immediately felt the onset of effects. Their self-concept began to disintegrate, starting with the separation of body parts (limbs, head, torso) and progressing down to subatomic particles. This process continued until their sense of self was completely dissolved.

After an indeterminate period, the participant's ego started to re-emerge. They regained self-awareness first, followed by sensory perception such as sight, touch, smell, taste, and hearing. The return of senses was accompanied by a surge of knowledge about how to interpret these sensations. As they reintegrated with their physical body, memories of their past life returned.

The participant felt tired both mentally and physically after the experience but managed to join a party where they enjoyed social interactions and had beers. They reported feeling relaxed, content, and uninhibited throughout the evening. The next day, they woke up refreshed and experienced a sense of warmth, confidence, and purpose that lasted for several hours."
599,32687,"The participant smoked a large amount of an unnamed substance after having taken it multiple times in recent days. They experienced tunnel vision and reality warping as usual but this time felt their consciousness pulled out of their body, looking down at themselves from above. The TV showed a scene where characters appeared to acknowledge the participant's presence and give instructions.

The participant saw multiple parallel realities swirling around them, each slightly different. In some, they were dead or had made different choices. They attempted to return to their original reality but felt pressured by an entity named Elane to choose correctly. After several attempts, they returned to their body feeling disoriented and agitated. Outside, they acted erratically and demanded a cigarette.

The experience lasted about 10-15 minutes subjectively felt like an eternity. The participant reported extreme fear and relief upon realizing they had made it back to reality."
600,45146,"参与者首次尝试该物质时，仅感受到轻微的身体不适和类似迷幻蘑菇的精神状态。随后在周末再次尝试，但未感到强烈的效果。最终，在一个晚上与两位室友一起进行了更大剂量的实验。第一位室友吸入后表现出强烈的反应，包括闭眼、笑闹和缓慢扭动身体，并表示体验非常奇特且感觉良好。第二位室友也接受了较大剂量的物质，同样表现出类似的第一位室友的症状，但更加静止不动。

参与者随后自己尝试了几乎铅笔橡皮大小的一剂物质，吸入后大约30秒开始起效，在40秒时达到高峰。他描述自己的体验为同时感受到五次酸性迷幻和一次巨大的笑气球的效果。音乐听起来非常美妙且完美。他的视野中出现了一幅宇宙般的画作，其中包含咖啡桌上的蜡烛以及室友的腿膝盖部分。这幅画成为了他存在的全部意义所在。

然而，当现实逐渐回归时，参与者意识到这幅宏大的宇宙画作实际上只是普通的桌子和室友的腿膝盖。这种突然的认知转变让他感到震惊，并感叹自己曾陷入如此扭曲的思想中。尽管仍感到轻微的身体高和精神恍惚，但他清楚地知道自己已经回到了现实中。他随后与室友讨论了在完全黑暗中的体验以及使用音乐可视化器的效果。"
601,31488,"The participant began their trip while sitting on a futon in a well-lit room after smoking the substance. They experienced intense physical sensations, including violent rotation to the right, which they tried to counteract by leaning left. This led to panic and anxiety as reality seemed to distort around them. The ground appeared to be wrapping around them like flipping pages of a book.

Visual hallucinations included black-on-black shapes that were felt intensely but not seen clearly. They had difficulty determining their body position and the location of their limbs. After about four minutes, they managed to plug in a lamp, which brought some sense of reality back. The rotating sensation gradually subsided over 40-45 minutes, with full return to baseline after an hour.

The experience was described as intense but not unpleasant once the participant understood what was happening. They noted that visual input seemed to fit tactile sensations, and darkness might have helped reduce panic."
602,55483,"The participant consumed a small amount of an unknown substance, which they believed to be ergot-derived LSA. Initially, the experience was mild and barely noticeable. After several hours, the participant brewed a tea from Peganum harmala seeds (Syrian Rue) to act as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). This combination produced a mildly psychedelic effect characterized by serpentine coils and undulations, enhanced visual imagery with eastern-mystical motifs, and mild tracers. The experience was described as relaxing, earthy, grounding yet psychedelic.

The participant then consumed a small amount of Salvia divinorum extract while in the plateau of effects from the LSA and MAOI combination. This addition resulted in the perception of multifaceted entities or beings that were strange but not hostile. Visuals shifted to fractal-like shapes resembling ivy vines, with sentient eyes throughout these patterns.

The aural experience included internal sounds with a tide-like quality, fluctuating tones, and techno-style sounds. These auditory effects sometimes increased in intensity just before sleep, causing brief awakenings.

Overall, the combination of substances produced a mildly psychedelic experience with enhanced visuals and auditory perceptions, as well as the perception of entities or beings."
603,50999,"The account describes four separate drug trips. The first two were less intense and took place in Central Park with a friend. In these experiences, the participant felt a force pulling them down and experienced timelessness and confusion about their surroundings. They also had difficulty forming coherent sentences and visual patterns did not materialize as expected.

In the third and fourth experiences, which were more profound, the participant meditated for an hour before ingesting the substance. During these trips, they encountered entities described as doctors or psychiatrists who examined them and allowed passage through a door. They also experienced floating through various landscapes including cityscapes, jungles, stone pyramids, and space.

The participant then encountered two female entities: one was described as an ancient motherly spirit, huge like a planet, who encouraged the participant to continue seeking knowledge and teaching others. The second entity was younger, green, and beautiful, almost sexual in nature, touching and filling the participant with power before they fell asleep."
604,54262,"The participant returned from Amsterdam with friends and purchased mushrooms and an extract of another substance. Upon arriving at a friend's house in Belgium, they consumed the mushrooms and later smoked a joint containing the extract. They watched a movie but found it difficult to concentrate due to intense laughter and visual distortions caused by the substances.

During one bathroom visit, the participant experienced vivid visuals involving a stretching toilet bowl and a world within the water. The group then went out for more cannabis, during which the room appeared to shift and transform in strange ways. Notably, posters on the wall began to move and mutate, with horses galloping towards a sun-like object.

Later, another joint was smoked, leading to hallucinations of tiny men forming networks throughout the environment. The participant's hand seemed connected to these entities, and they felt a strange substance covering their body. After this intense experience, the group watched more movies while sobering up.

The next day, the participant smoked the extract alone in their room. They experienced open-eyed visuals where everything appeared to be made of tiny interconnected men. Their arm remained in its original position as they moved it, and they felt a watery substance spreading over them. The music became loud, and they attempted to turn it down but found themselves transferring into the stereo and then between objects.

In a subsequent session, the participant again smoked the extract but did not fully trip. They experienced memories from previous trips and had visions of their life as a series of pictures, with a new picture attempting to replace them. This caused fear and resistance until they returned to normalcy."
605,34073,"The participant took a large dose of an unknown substance and immediately felt intense effects without any gradual onset. They lost their sense of self and reality, seeing multiple versions of themselves in fractal-like patterns that outlined various objects and shapes. An entity called the Gatekeeper appeared briefly before dissolving back into the experience. The user eventually regained some control but experienced lingering effects for a while after, including difficulty with simple tasks like showering."
606,36026,"The individual began their experience by consuming a substance through a bong. They then sat down with a magazine to try to achieve a sexual rush but found themselves unable to become aroused. As the effects set in, they experienced visual distortions where everything broke up into kaleidoscopic shapes and continually morphed.

Feeling uneasy about potential visitors, the participant tried to tidy up evidence of their activity while feeling an increasing sense of urgency and panic due to impaired motor skills. They felt as if everyone around them could hear their movements and had a clear window into their mind, making them feel psychologically naked and exposed.

The individual imagined that others were discussing their actions and feared being caught like a rabbit in the headlights. They experienced anxiety about social judgment and tried to pick up small pieces of glass they had accidentally broken, pretending to be more successful than they actually were.

Feeling hot and noticing a wet patch on their shorts, they decided to take a shower, still feeling watched and judged by others. Afterward, they changed the music from a track that seemed to confirm their telepathic exposure to one that provided relief. The experience lasted about fifteen minutes with an afterglow for an hour.

Overall, the trip was characterized by intense feelings of exposure, anxiety about being observed, and difficulty maintaining privacy or normalcy in social situations."
607,59083,"The individual began their trip with the ingestion of a substance, settling in for an evening alone at home. As the effects intensified, they experienced vivid visualizations and introspective thoughts. During this period, they heard a heated argument from neighbors involving child abuse, which deeply unsettled them but did not significantly alter the course of their trip.

Later, while preparing to smoke salvia extract, they were overwhelmed by sounds of domestic violence next door. The participant felt compelled to intervene but was too high and decided instead to shut out the noise and hide illegal substances due to paranoia about potential police involvement. After some time, they smoked the prepared salvia, leading to a profound shift in consciousness.

In this altered state, the individual perceived themselves as a 12 or 13-year-old boy living through intense family conflict and violence. They witnessed their mother being physically abused by their father and felt compelled to intervene despite the danger. The experience included vivid memories of past abuse, growing anger towards the abuser, and contemplation of violent retribution.

The participant imagined a scenario where they would stab their father with a kitchen knife in an act of vengeance. After this imagined event, they returned to their bedroom, crying and horrified by what had transpired. Upon returning to reality, they were emotionally affected and felt compelled to document the experience through writing.

Over the following hours, the participant reflected on the profound impact of the trip, which changed their perspective on children and motivated them to help others in similar situations."
608,35607,"The participant and their friend smoked an extract three times, increasing the dose each time. In the first experience, the participant felt like a small pet unable to reach objects and perceived the room as more three-dimensional. They briefly stood beside themselves and moved slippers around. The second experience was stronger but less memorable; they looped scenes where they looked around corners at their friend, saying ""What?"" repeatedly for about two minutes before returning to normal consciousness. In the third experience, the participant believed they were part of a 'Rollladenschaft' (shuttership), an entity that rolled continuously with thousands of faces staring in panic. They felt trapped and struggled to return to normal consciousness for about 20 minutes before finally breaking free. The aftereffects included a prolonged sense of unreality."
609,47109,"The individual experienced several distinct phases during their trip. In one phase, an elephant appeared beside them, growing from its snout. It had a grey body with red strings attached due to sweat and red hay in the environment. The elephant was slightly startled by drummers but calmed down when petted. They led it through a circus tent course while band members played brass instruments.

In another phase, a plant-like entity appeared and spoke to them. This entity had a face carved into its petals, resembling a commander or god. It communicated gently yet dominantly, emphasizing the importance of respect and readiness to learn. Following this interaction, they were transported to a wooded area where they heard a symphony of nature's sounds.

Next, a large seed appeared in front of them, about half their height, matching the color of the plant entity. This was followed by an underwater experience with a colorful fish and bubbly noises blending with the earlier woodland sounds.

Finally, vines entangled around the individual, who felt embraced rather than constricted. The plant's voice welcomed them as its child, and they experienced enlightenment about their purpose, accompanied by the repeated symphony of nature's sounds."
610,55943,"The participant felt an initial expansion of awareness followed by a sudden condensation into a single point, marking the onset of the experience. This led to a dissolution of the ego and immersion in a kaleidoscopic, multidimensional realm where the distinction between self and universe was blurred. The imagery was incomprehensible and three-dimensional perception dissolved.

A being or entity was encountered within this realm, though its specific characteristics were not detailed beyond the implication that it may be synonymous with the realm itself. As the experience progressed, the participant learned to interact with the dimension by flowing with its energy and absorbing its teachings. The imagery eventually slowed down, and cognitive function gradually returned.

Upon re-entering the physical world, the participant experienced an enhanced perception of reality that persisted for several days. The overall effect was described as a spiritual ally that could be used again but required respect and proper context to avoid potential negative outcomes."
611,31569,"The individual prepared for an unspecified psychedelic session in their apartment, aiming to confront past traumas and neuroses. They took a staggered dose of a tincture sublingually, experiencing initial laughter before entering a dreamy state. The participant listened to music and attempted to recall childhood memories but found the process slower than usual. They had vague impressions of toys from an old house and their mother's car from when they were younger. After about 40-50 minutes, the individual fell asleep and woke up without any significant lingering effects, driving their girlfriend home shortly after."
612,32672,"The participant (L) was introduced to a new psychoactive substance by his friend D in an apartment room with low ambient light. After consuming the substance, L appeared confused and agitated, looking around the room and muttering to himself. He then stood up quickly and walked towards the bed but bumped into a wall while attempting to walk through it. The sitters assisted him onto the bed where he lay down with his head in an uncomfortable position.

L's eyes were described as ""crazed"" during this time, and he did not speak much until later when he seemed to be coming down from the effects of the substance. He then began describing his experience, mentioning that the colors of the room and ceiling had a special meaning for him. L felt that the sitters knew about an end-of-existence lesson and that they had planned the session in advance. Additionally, he mentioned feeling compelled to stand up and walk out of the room, even though he did not see the wall."
613,53222,"The participant begins by smoking a generous dose of extract and sitting cross-legged with eyes closed. Initially, they feel calm and clear-minded, but as time progresses, they enter a vivid visual state. They perceive themselves within a rotating tunnel or cave, where their face and body appear in various forms on the walls, representing different aspects of their personality. As they continue to experience this, they move further down the tunnel, encountering runes that symbolize stages of self-realization.

Eventually, the participant reaches a point where they let go of their sense of self and perceive a bright light at the end of the tunnel, which represents a higher consciousness or divine presence. This moment is described as both beautiful and sorrowful, reflecting on the transient nature of existence. The experience lasts approximately four minutes before resolving back to normal perception.

Afterwards, the participant feels an emotional charge similar to post-rush heroin effects but with a concurrent sense of sadness."
614,42679,"The participant began their experience while sitting beside a barbecue at around 8:00 pm. They smoked a large amount of the substance, which caused immediate effects. Initially, they felt a distortion in vision and heaviness in muscles. As the effects intensified, they struggled to stand up and leaned on the barbecue's surface.

During this period, the participant experienced their body twisting uncomfortably but painlessly. Their surroundings began to swirl into a colorful dimension, detaching them from reality. They became fixated on standing up despite being unaware of their physical form. The experience included interactions with an undefined higher being that prevented them from achieving their goal.

After reaching the peak of the high, the participant slowly regained consciousness and returned to reality. Upon regaining awareness, they found themselves sitting back on the step, looking at everyone's feet without recognizing what they were seeing. They attempted to communicate but struggled to form coherent sentences before eventually speaking again.

The experience concluded with a brief period of physical burnout followed by complete sobriety and relaxation."
615,28488,"The participant began by smoking a small amount of an unnamed substance but did not feel its effects immediately. After about 30 minutes, they started experiencing a disconnection from reality and intense physical sensations such as heart palpitations and body pulsations. The visual perception became distorted; for example, the TV screen appeared to be a separate entity while everything else seemed two-dimensional.

The participant experienced vivid hallucinations where objects and people took on exaggerated characteristics. For instance, someone standing up was seen spinning and chugging vodka in their mind's eye before opening their eyes to see them adjusting the TV reception. The user also reported seeing electric shadows and clay figures battling each other when closing their eyes.

Social interactions were intensified; emotions and attitudes of others became more pronounced. The participant felt a strong connection with the vibe or energy around them, which would then dissipate quickly as they shifted focus. There was a significant memory loss for recent events, similar to what is experienced on other psychedelic drugs but more intense.

Physical sensations included dry mouth and an orgasmic euphoria when flexing muscles. The user also reported feeling like they were walking on the moon or through hospital corridors due to altered perceptions of their environment. Listening to music felt like it was pulsating through their body, and simple actions such as drinking from a can created vivid hallucinations.

The effects lasted for approximately 6-8 hours, with residual mental effects lasting into the next day."
616,49585,"The individual experienced an intense journey characterized by vivid visuals and encounters with multiple entities. Initially, there was a sudden onset of visual disturbances, including dark fields of vision that gradually filled with vibrant patterns and colors. Tunnel-like visions were reported, along with intertwining vines and mirror images extending into infinity. The participant noted the presence of numbers and patterns without limits.

Voices and whispers surrounded them, discussing various aspects of life. As the experience progressed, the individual encountered a field with strange entities and colors, including purple hues and glowing sensations. They ascended to great heights, experiencing a splicing sensation where their body felt segmented into different parts. Laughter was heard, and there were references to uncontrollable forces.

The participant then entered what they described as a lizard kingdom, encountering an infinitely large temple with pulsating beats and Mayan symbols. Various colored lizards were present, and the individual engaged in conversations with entities that had familiar yet alien qualities. The experience included erotic encounters and cosmic visions of galactic proportions.

Throughout the journey, there were mentions of DMT-like patterns and entities, including a friendly being referred to as ""ska."" The participant reported blacking out after approximately 10 minutes according to their sitter."
617,25506,"The participant began by chewing an eight-leaf quid of a substance, experiencing initial discomfort due to its bitterness. Around 1:05 AM, they noticed something was not 'normal' but could not pinpoint exactly what it was. By 1:10 AM, their eyes felt heavy and closed, leading to a vision where they flowed into the body of a dove which then transformed into a jet plane taking off. They were advised by an angelic voice to forget about the quid in their mouth and catch this plane.

At around 1:20 AM, the participant's body began to transform, first feeling heavy as if made of wood, with branches and leaves sprouting from their feet. They struggled to expel a second quid but eventually managed to do so after becoming immobile on the floor due to an intense sensation of gravity.

Around 1:40 AM, they experienced a profound transformation into a verdant countryside, lying face down beneath the roots of great trees while feeling connected to the Earth and everything in it as part of one universal organism. This was accompanied by music from Douglas Spotted Eagle's Dieshu, which sounded like a joyful dirge.

The experience peaked with a vision of a miniature night sky inside their computer, persisting for several minutes before fading. By 1:50 AM, the participant had returned to writing about the experience while still processing its intensity and beauty."
618,51512,"The participant experienced a sudden onset of effects after inhaling thick smoke from a bowl containing an extract of a psychedelic herb. They lost awareness of their surroundings for several minutes, as reported by others present. During this time, they felt intense visual and emotional sensations characterized by organic colors (yellow, green, orange, black) and textures reminiscent of leaves and pastels.

The participant's consciousness was described as being ""peeled"" and ""rolled"" into different objects or organisms, blurring the distinction between living and non-living things. They perceived themselves as a wooden plank in a boat under construction, feeling a sense of insignificance and loss of their human identity while an essence of self remained present.

Upon regaining awareness, the participant felt extremely hot and sweaty, with a strong urge to cool down. They listened to music through headphones, experiencing it vividly as if it were a living world. The effects lingered into the next day, influencing their perception during skiing activities."
619,43595,"The participant took a substance prepared from cactus and experienced nausea initially but managed to vomit before the effects set in. As the trip progressed, they noticed distinct visual patterns resembling Aztec designs that covered surfaces and objects, sometimes creating an illusion of depthlessness where colors and distances seemed connected. The visuals were accompanied by mild jaw clenching.

The participant attended a New Year's Eve celebration with friends in a city, which was crowded and noisy due to alcohol consumption and fireworks displays. Despite the challenging environment, they found amusement in the situation and felt protected while walking through the city. They experienced fear when facing their reflection in a dimly lit bathroom but later returned to face it without fear or anxiety.

During this time, one friend (the Ego) was under the influence of ecstasy and another (the Drunk) consumed alcohol. The participant engaged in philosophical discussions with the Ego about letting go of attachments and desires. They also observed the Drunk's behavior and interactions with others but did not feel a strong connection to these individuals.

The midnight fireworks were less impressive than the city lights, which seemed more interesting due to the altered state of consciousness. The participant smoked salvia later in the evening, experiencing intense visual effects that included unzipping reality and vivid colors. They saw caricatures of their friends in frightening scenarios but did not resist these images.

After coming down from both substances, the participant reflected on the experience, noting a sense of isolation during the celebration due to being deeply immersed in their own thoughts and perceptions."
620,24086,"The participant began their experience by inhaling a substance through a homemade bong. They felt a tingling sensation and experienced a shift in equilibrium, along with rotating peripheral vision. The hardwood floor appeared more intense, and they perceived an entity inviting them to lie down on their futon. This entity was initially described as female but later genderless.

The participant felt anxious and uncomfortable during the peak of the experience, noting a desire to ""jump out of my skin."" They managed to walk around after 20 minutes but experienced some difficulty with coordination. The initial session ended with the participant feeling bummed out about their decision to use the substance before work.

Later in the evening, they decided to try again in a more controlled environment. This time, they felt as if they were composed of intelligent particles and had an extended sense of self beyond just their brain. They perceived shapes projecting from where they thought their line of sight and arms were located. The entity was now seen as benevolent and playful.

The participant observed that entities exist in the gaps between perceptual spaces and found this idea comical. They stared at a spot on the floor where rubber mats met the door, experiencing it as reduced to two dimensions under the influence. This created visual tension which they associated with an entity's domain.

After about 20 minutes of the second session, the participant felt comfortable enough to step outside and smoke a cigarette, feeling grateful for the experience and considering the substance a valuable ally."
621,23058,"The participant describes several attempts to use an unnamed substance, initially with limited success due to inadequate smoking equipment. On one occasion, they used a bong for better results. After four rapid hits, they experienced sudden and intense effects. They attempted to communicate with 'María,' believed to be the plant intelligence of the substance, but were unable to complete their thoughts. Visual hallucinations included a many-colored pattern resembling a starfish with partially opened mouths in each part. The figure was fluid and rotated slowly. The participant felt stupefied and awestruck by these visuals.

The experience caused time dilation, making it seem timeless despite knowing the trip would be brief. Motor control returned after a few minutes, allowing them to hide the smoking apparatus due to perceived external presence. They quickly returned to normalcy within a couple of minutes. The participant notes that this substance requires careful handling and mental preparation for beneficial experiences.

After the session, they observed lasting positive changes in their cognitive function and emotional state, including increased creativity, reduced depression, and enhanced spiritual well-being."
622,45735,"The individual smoked a substance after consuming cannabis and alcohol. Upon inhaling, they felt an abrupt shift in consciousness as if entering a new layer of reality separate from their own. They perceived the segment of reality they occupied getting separated from others, like a single link pulled upward in a chain. A Queen or Mother presence seemed to halt all forms of reality.

The participant experienced various physical and mental sensations including becoming aware of an entirely new field of reality with its own logic. Visuals were described as contradictory, appearing at the end of a dream but not clear enough for vivid recognition. They worried about describing their experiences later on, which transformed into something relevant to the current state of consciousness.

Entities appeared in the form of dragons communicating telepathically and other beings that interacted with the participant. The experience included feelings of being unzipped, becoming flat wooden faces, and worrying about irrational things within this altered reality. 

The trip ended when the individual became aware of their thoughts as irrational. They noted a sensation of looking up or down while lying horizontally on the bed towards the end of the experience."
623,21844,"The individual took an unspecified substance, likely in extract form, while in a dorm room with their girlfriend. Upon inhaling the substance, they experienced immediate physical sensations including vibrations across their skin and a feeling of weight on their body. Their vision became distorted, manifesting as visual stimuli that were sensed rather than seen clearly.

The participant perceived patterns on a tapestry moving rapidly towards the ceiling and then continuing across the room. They interpreted this as an attempt by their consciousness to close off into another realm but felt constrained by the presence of their sober girlfriend. This led to a sense of frustration and distraction.

As the experience progressed, the individual saw the ceiling as if it were the floor of various rooms they had been in throughout their life, evoking vivid impressions of these spaces without clear visual details. When the girlfriend moved out of sight, the participant briefly felt she had disappeared, causing momentary fear before realizing its absurdity.

The entire experience lasted approximately six minutes, with a strong sense of time dilation making it feel much longer. The individual laughed and spoke incoherently during parts of the trip. Afterward, they experienced an hour-long period of contemplation about what had transpired."
624,20032,"The participant had three experiences with a substance that produced varying effects. In the first two attempts, they experienced mild sensations similar to cannabis, including a brief falling sensation during the first try and altered peripheral vision during the second. The third attempt was more intense and led to vivid dreams and visual disturbances. During this experience, the participant saw fractal patterns and felt anxiety. They also heard an English phrase in their mind: ""Salvia is not a torturer... She's a healer."" In one dream, two doctors restrained a creature with large claws that resembled swords, which was described as holding onto something (the participant). A third doctor advised against smoking the substance after watching disturbing movies due to creating a negative aura. The creature in the dream was interpreted as this bad aura, and the doctors were seen as healers. Another dream involved an instructor teaching astral projection techniques to friends, with a character resembling Samwise Gangee from ""The Lord of the Rings"" appearing and giving car keys to the participant."
625,19945,"The participant smoked the substance in a group setting but only felt effects after smoking alone later that night. They reported feeling an odd sensation of needing to ""declare borders"" and make ""distance measurements,"" with physical objects like their hoodie sweatshirt feeling like force fields. 

Alone, they experienced vivid visuals including a moving poster where women conversed and album covers were alive. Their room walls glowed purple, and the ceiling transformed into a brightly colored, swirly fractal vortex that expanded, contracted, and spun both forward and backward. The vortex displayed faces of band members from Pink Floyd, aging as they circled.

After the vortex disappeared, their room appeared to ripple like water, with goo-like material growing out of walls and carpeting. Talking trees similar to those in Mortal Kombat 2 appeared on the ceiling, along with Sesame Street alien creatures making ""yep yep uh huh"" sounds. One tree spoke about the participant's love for weed while another discussed their experience with acid.

The visuals lasted approximately 25 minutes before returning to normal. The participant reported no fear and described the experience as enjoyable but potentially overwhelming for others."
626,18433,"The individual began their experience in a darkened living room after inhaling two hits of a substance from a small metal pipe. Initially, they noticed slight changes including hearing voices in their head that seemed playful and friendly, advising them to hold the smoke longer for a more profound effect. As the effects intensified, reality appeared to warp into the stereo, with walls drawing towards it as if being drained through a sink. Reality also became two-dimensional.

The participant experienced a sense of déjà vu, feeling familiar with their surroundings as though they had returned home after years apart. The peak experience involved reality melting into thin stripes of muted color that formed a river flowing in rhythm to music playing on a Raymond Scott CD. This river seemed to flow somewhere, and the individual felt total liberation from ego, body, and environment.

After this peak, when closing their eyes, they saw patterns forming one after another, each identical, suggesting that everything is interconnected. The experience concluded with a sense of learning about life and death but without clear understanding at the time."
627,18993,"The participant began by preparing for an oral dose of an unnamed substance, using techniques to enhance absorption. In a dark room with music playing, they experienced increased gravity and visual patterns that evolved into geometric shapes resembling masks. As the experience deepened, they entered what they called the ""4th dimension,"" a pitch-black space where thousands of beings were asleep. The participant received a message about the need for change to avoid being trapped in this place forever.

Feeling panicked, the participant attempted to return to their physical body by opening their eyes and spitting out the substance. They noticed that music responded synchronistically to their actions, which heightened their sense of reality and fear. After turning off the music, they called a cousin to discuss the experience, feeling shaken but relieved to share it with someone.

The next day, the participant felt physically shocked and continued to process the event, considering its implications for future use of the substance."
628,19080,"The participant begins in an unfamiliar red desert, feeling disoriented and unable to recall how they arrived there or their identity. They walk for hours through the desert until they reach a small town. In the town, they encounter a woman who speaks an unknown language and gives them a mysterious stone before pointing at a house. The participant enters this house but finds it locked. As they approach the garage door, they feel as though they are falling through it into another realm.

In this new realm, the participant observes various stages of their life depicted in pages of a giant book. They see themselves growing older and experiencing different emotions and situations. Eventually, they come across a page showing them as an elderly person with a grave bearing their name, which causes panic. The participant then realizes they can turn the pages of the book using their willpower.

The participant continues to observe their life in reverse until they reach childhood. They recognize two adults depicted in the book as their parents and realize that time exists within this realm. As they continue observing, a specific picture draws them closer, leading them back into the physical world where they are sitting with friends John and Sarah. The participant experiences intense emotions upon realizing the substance they smoked was salvia.

After returning to the physical world, the participant feels disoriented and reflects on their experience, questioning the nature of reality and time."
629,16112,"The individual was alone at home when they decided to use the substance. They first experienced being a young French man in a late 19th-century European setting, sitting on a cathedral-like building ledge. An older female figure called out to him from the foreground, urging him to come down. The experience felt very real and immersive.

After another dose, the individual perceived themselves as part of a Native American tribe where ""Big Bear"" was a leader who demanded cleanliness. They found themselves cleaning their pipe and picking up paper off the floor to please ""Big Bear.""

In subsequent experiences, they felt like they were borrowing someone else's consciousness. This included perceiving things from another person's perspective and even identifying specific details about this other individual, such as their birth date and place.

The trip lasted for over an hour, during which time the individual experienced various entities and altered perceptions of reality."
630,40528,"The account describes a drug trip where two individuals prepare for their experience in a calm environment. The partner consumes the substance first and exhibits confusion, anger, and physical movements before collapsing and laughing hysterically. After encouragement from the partner, the main participant takes the substance and experiences visual hallucinations and time travel. They feel as though they are merging with different objects such as a clock and a vine, traveling through various dimensions, and encountering an entity described as neither male nor female. The entity guides them through their journey, providing positive energy and encouraging them to let go of their current reality. After the experience, the participant feels a profound sense of connection with all living beings and believes they have much more to learn from this substance."
631,17986,"The individual began experiencing effects shortly after ingesting the substance. They heard voices whispering what they perceived as a disturbing hymn, which later turned out to be an internal auditory hallucination. The participant felt intense laughter and then entered a state where their consciousness seemed to merge with the universe, feeling no body and immense euphoria.

Upon opening their eyes, they saw the room and experienced blending with inanimate objects like the bed and curtain beads. This led to sensations of being split between multiple objects simultaneously, causing deep confusion and overwhelming emotions. The participant felt torn between numerous places at once, experiencing intense chaos that nearly overwhelmed them. They sought fresh air outside due to the high level of stimulation."
632,16590,"The participant began by taking two heavy hits from a glass water pipe containing dried leaves. After the first hit, they experienced an immediate shift in awareness and felt extremely large, with distant objects appearing closer. The second hit intensified these effects, causing disorientation and discomfort. They noticed irritation to their skin and a general feeling of unease.

While standing, the participant focused on a fire, which became the center of their universe, pulling their field of vision towards it. They attempted to find comfort by drinking water but experienced panic and paranoia. Time seemed to pass quickly, with 20 minutes feeling like only two minutes had passed.

The participant took two more hits, leading to complete loss of self-awareness. Upon returning, they experienced several hallucinations: one where they were attached to a cylindrical object trying to peel away; another where the world appeared colorless and featureless; and a realization that they were the only thing existing, causing fear and a struggle for independence.

After sitting silently for an extended period, the participant stood up and asked for help. They recognized their guide by name but felt confused about his presence. As reality slowly returned, objects regained their normal level of detail, and the participant was able to converse with friends again. The experience left them feeling awake and grateful for life, though not 'fun' in a conventional sense."
633,16872,"The individual begins their experience by smoking a substance and immediately notices decorative cubic shapes resembling ancient Mayan glyphs. They feel as if they are being dragged along a current, experiencing visual distortions that resemble leaves and leafy structures. The participant's father asks questions, but the individual struggles to respond due to the ongoing effects.

Leaving the room, the person lies down in their old bedroom with closed eyes, traveling through a vegetative corridor accompanied by a singing female voice. They encounter a maze-like structure with organic machinery and fantasy elements that blend into the physical environment. The visuals become translucent against the blackness of their eyelids, showing subtle and stunning patterns.

The next day, the individual experiences dreams dominated by giant, distorted plant forms resembling fungi or mold. These plants are secondary to the dream's narrative but visually prominent. In a second session, they smoke more of the substance in a backyard setting. They notice enhanced auditory perception, with bird sounds filtered through a matrix of leaves, creating a crystaline and reverberant sound.

As the effects intensify, their vision begins to group and blend, forming walls of green plants. A creature resembling a locust-human-plant hybrid is observed meditating in the center of these structures. Closing their eyes reveals vivid color shifts and geometric patterns. The participant follows an abstract stream of ideas, encountering cross-currents and visualizing complex shapes.

They approach a construct with a throne and a holy figure emitting light from its stomach and holding a scepter and orb. Despite attempts to reach this being, the individual remains at the threshold, unable to fully enter. They transform into a long, leafy worm-like cylinder and navigate through a cylindrical cavern using muscular contractions accompanied by iconic sounds and abstract glyphs.

The experience concludes with the participant partially inside the figure, their eyes within its glowing heart. As the vision dissipates, they return to their original chair on the hill."
634,16088,"The participant experienced a sudden onset of altered perception after ingesting an unnamed substance. They felt their reality split apart into small segments that tumbled and shifted, creating disorientation. During this experience, they perceived themselves in various realities or dimensions, including those of other individuals who were also using the substance.

In one instance, the participant found themselves in a British teenager's bedroom, another on a bus with strangers staring at them, and yet another in an alley with a girl helping them. They struggled to maintain their sense of self and reality as these segments shifted rapidly around them.

The experience was accompanied by physical sensations such as difficulty maintaining balance due to the shifting perception of ""up."" The participant also interacted with animals, specifically dogs, who did not exhibit the same dimensional shifts as inanimate objects.

After returning home, the participant attempted a second smaller dose and experienced similar but less intense effects. They again perceived themselves in various realities, including what seemed like holding areas for travelers between dimensions. Each time, they had to consciously pull their consciousness back to their original reality.

The experience was described as mechanical rather than organic, with precise patterns of shifting dimensions that felt more akin to a physical phenomenon than an hallucination."
635,15393,"The individual prepared for a Salvia experience outdoors on a rainy night after growing the plants for several months. They chewed six leaves while lying in a reclining chair, feeling no immediate effects at first. Subtle waves of movement and faint greenish closed-eye visuals were noted as the effects began to manifest.

As the intensity increased, the participant felt their body becoming jelly-like and experienced a sense of being massaged through the fabric of the chair. They recalled a previous experience where they felt like they were being pulled out of their body through the top of their head. The closed-eye visuals shifted from greenish glows to a black void that seemed vast and calm.

The participant wished for complete darkness but was distracted by light and noise, prompting them to move indoors. There, they covered their eyes with a pillow and perceived a smoky greenish glow forming in the void. As the effects wore off, they noticed a negative, scowly-faced version of themselves attempting to attach to their ego.

The experience concluded with pleasant dreams about family and joyful walks in New York City, leaving the participant feeling positive and assured for days afterward."
636,12959,"The individual prepared for a high-dose experience by recruiting two guides (his girlfriend and roommate) to assist him. He inhaled a large amount of smoke from a glass Turkish water-bong containing approximately 325 mg of the substance. After inhaling, he experienced intense visual and auditory hallucinations, feeling as though he was spinning down a colorful vortex into an inner dimension.

During this experience, he encountered two entities that felt familiar yet distinctively otherworldly. These entities were described as comforting figures holding onto him to prevent him from being pulled further into the alternate dimension. The participant realized these entities were his girlfriend and roommate in the physical world, who were disturbed by his yelling for help during the trip.

The experience was characterized by a sense of losing one's body and becoming immersed in vivid childhood memories. There was no logical structure to the journey; instead, it felt like an exaggerated exploration of subconscious fears and emotions. The participant described feeling like a child in a perplexing world, with fear or joy influencing subsequent perceptions.

After approximately 8 minutes, the experience began to subside as the participant became aware of his physical surroundings again. His guides were deeply disturbed by the intensity of his reaction and vowed never to try the substance again due to its powerful effects."
637,39981,"The participant experienced multiple sessions with an unknown substance before having a profound trip at a party after consuming alcohol. During this session, they smoked a large amount of the substance in one hit. Initially, their vision became clouded, and they perceived a tan wall adorned with purple and cyan ridges instead of the actual snowy yard. They felt like a bodiless entity of light, roaming existence.

As the experience progressed, the participant's perception fragmented, with reality appearing as slivers alongside the hallucinatory wall. They struggled to communicate verbally but managed to convey 'Uh... uh... eh... uh...' repeatedly. Friends at the party observed and reacted in amazement and laughter.

Gradually, the participant regained a sense of self and physicality, realizing they were part of a social group with obligations. This led to personal revelations about the preciousness of life and the privilege of being alive. They felt honored to be among the living and resolved to appreciate their existence more fully, becoming happier and more open.

The experience concluded with the participant walking inside and rejoining the party, still feeling a significant buzz."
638,40053,"The participant prepared for the experience by sitting comfortably on pillows with dried sage lit and a single candle burning. They wore an opaque mask over their eyes after inhaling the substance. The first sensation was a grid-like pattern appearing in their visual field, followed by a feeling of melting into an unfamiliar matrix. This led to a sense of losing connection to reality and becoming immersed in what felt like dream space. During this period, they experienced thoughts emanating from something beyond themselves, likened to being connected to the entire World Wide Web or realizing that islands are part of one vast underwater continent. After about five minutes, they opened their eyes and returned to normal consciousness, feeling safe but struggling to describe the experience."
639,34053,"The participant describes two experiences with an unnamed substance. The first experience was characterized by a rapid onset and took them off guard. In the second, more intense experience, which occurred in a living room setting with several people present, the individual felt their mind detach from reality after smoking the substance. They experienced a sensation of being pulled into a hole in the floor by a humanoid entity about 3 feet tall with dark, constantly moving skin and fluorescent blue veins covering its body. The participant attempted to resist but eventually allowed the entity to climb onto them.

The participant then had an out-of-body experience where they perceived themselves as the small entity and walked around the room, touching another person's shoulders without physically moving from their position against a wall. This interaction caused the other person to feel a chill down her spine despite not having taken any substances herself. The entire experience lasted approximately ten minutes but felt much longer."
640,14953,"A 30-year-old scientist decided to try Salvia Divinorum after reading about its effects online. He first used a sublingual tincture but felt only minor effects. Later, he and his uncles tried smoking the substance. The author experienced a strong sense of separation from his body, vivid visual distortions including translucent jelly-like substances, and an intense feeling of being in a new place. His uncle Xander had similar visuals but also saw a black hole-like dome trying to suck him in. Uncle Xavier felt no effects initially but later reported seeing the room warp into the TV screen and experiencing multiple layers of reality.

After smoking, they used the tincture sublingually. The author experienced emotional sensations and enhanced perception outdoors. Xander had visual double vision and somnolent states, passing in and out of consciousness while performing actions slowly. He saw locks, keys, nurses, and two versions of objects and people. His speech was slurred, and his eyes were puffy and lazy.

The next day, Xander felt fine but reported a brief moment of double vision that morning after taking Dilaudid for back pain. He gave communion to the author and his other uncle as an act of repentance and setting things right."
641,22617,"The participant began by smoking a small amount of extract in a low-light setting with a sitter present. After inhaling, they entered what is referred to as 'Salvia space', where they experienced a purple environment and felt like a child in an adult realm. In this state, the individual encountered a long bridge made entirely of eyes, though their recollection of specific events on the bridge was hazy. They communicated non-verbally with another consciousness but did not recall any profound revelations.

As the experience began to wane, the participant felt fear and disorientation while reentering normal reality. They experienced confusion about their identity and surroundings, feeling as if they were part of a bridge anchored to their teeth. The return to physical form was accompanied by difficulty speaking and an intense sensation of heat. After regaining speech, it took approximately fifteen minutes for the participant to fully regain awareness.

The experience was described as more intense than previous hallucinogen use, with a strong recommendation for using a sitter due to the potential for disorientation during the return to normal reality. The individual reported feeling invigorated and happy in the hours following the experience, contrasting this with the lingering effects of other hallucinogens."
642,11919,"The first participant felt floaty and experienced visual distortions such as seeing panels of material hanging in front of them and moving through what they perceived as the base element of existence. They also saw Brahma and later felt surrounded by a bubble-like atmosphere. The second participant laughed, rolled around, and talked about elephants and snakes before sitting up wide-eyed after the effects subsided."
643,13948,"The participant experienced an intense visual transformation where their dorm room turned into a night-time city street scene. They observed ten people walking on the street, all wearing similar tan-colored coats. The individuals walked towards the participant without raising their heads, except for one young to middle-aged black male who briefly made eye contact before continuing his walk. The vision included sounds of footsteps and faint talking. After this interaction, the hallucination began to dissolve, with furniture and room elements twisting back into place until they returned to normal."
644,10201,"In a darkened room with two friends, the participant consumed a large hit of an extract substance through a water pipe. They immediately felt disconnected from their surroundings and experienced visual disturbances, including seeing a large black wave of void to their right. The individual became confused about who they were and what was happening, asking their friends repeatedly what they were doing.

The participant perceived pressure from an unseen authority figure and felt the need to hide or protect something (the bong) from punishment. They began sweating profusely and feeling anxious, crying out that their friends should stop yelling at them and begging for them to stop. The individual ran towards a door across the room, then knelt down beside a bed with their face buried in the comforter.

Gradually regaining awareness, the participant asked if their friends had experienced the same world they did but was told no. They felt frantic and out of control, trying to understand where they had been. As the effects wore off, the individual felt uneasy and darkened, seeking cannabis to balance or eliminate the negative feelings from the experience."
645,8341,"The participant began their experience by preparing mentally and physically, darkening the room and listening to soft music. They then administered a dose of an unspecified substance sublingually and waited for effects to set in. As the effects took hold, they lost physical orientation but remained aware of their surroundings. The passage of time became indistinct.

The participant reported entering a vivid mental state where they perceived themselves as a glowing white disk within a vast matrix of similar disks interconnected by flowing green lines. These disks were interpreted as representations of angels and souls. The space was described as permitting more interconnectedness than typical dimensions, with a pervasive sense of joy.

As the experience began to wane, the participant regained some awareness of their physical environment but still felt partially immersed in the altered state. They interacted briefly with their surroundings before retiring to bed, where they experienced residual effects including vivid dreams and a tranquil feeling upon waking."
646,8438,"The individual smoked a large dose of a substance and experienced a brief shutdown of brain function. They then entered an altered state where they perceived themselves in an earthy cavern inside their mind. In this state, they observed intense sensations and emotions related to pain and confusion. The participant realized that they were supposed to be alive but was enjoying the strange environment so much that it caused a sense of panic when the thought of returning to normal reality crossed their mind.

After some time in the cavern-like state, the individual suddenly became aware of having a body and being in a room, with the cavern appearing as an extra dimension blocking their view of reality. They experienced alternating periods between the altered state and normal reality, trying to communicate with others but finding it difficult due to confusion and lack of complex thoughts.

The experience lasted for several minutes, during which the participant was observed smiling and occasionally waving their arms while attempting to talk about 'chunks' (sections or parts of the cavern). Afterward, they felt confused for about 30 minutes, struggling to understand what people were saying and having difficulty expressing themselves. The positive and humorous impression lingered for a day after the experience."
647,31726,"In a bedroom setting with four friends present, the individual took two doses of a substance from a pipe. After inhaling the second dose, they experienced an immediate onset of effects. Initially standing alone in their room, everything appeared brightly lit and objects seemed to flatten into cardboard cutouts. Three parallel lines on one wall began to widen, resembling zippers.

The participant perceived three friends attached to these 'zippers' as if unzipping reality. A female consciousness was felt behind them, communicating strange thoughts about the nature of existence. The individual became confused and panicked when they realized their memory had returned but could not reconcile it with the ongoing hallucinations.

Their friends appeared to be in a similar state, urging the participant to help unzip reality. The participant resisted, feeling fear as parts of the room disappeared with a popping sound. They ran out of the bedroom into the kitchen and then outside, where they saw their house disappear completely. Overwhelmed by fear, they crouched on the ground, accepting their fate.

After an indeterminate period, the experience ended abruptly when the participant's roommate appeared in front of them. The individual returned to normal consciousness but with fragmented memory and strange visual effects as they re-entered the house. Friends reported that the entire episode lasted about 90 seconds, during which time the participant did not speak."
648,29222,"The participant and a friend consumed substance A together from a shared pipe. They then each took a dose of substance B sublingually, with the participant experiencing mild visual effects such as tracers and retinal burn, which were unusual for them. Following this, they prepared a bowl containing a combination of substances (referred to hereafter as ""Havok"") including resin from substance A, extract of substance B, and Calea Zacatechichi. The participant inhaled the second hit of this mixture.

The effects were immediate and intense, with closed-eye visuals becoming more detailed and realistic due to the influence of Calea Zacatechichi. However, the participant's memory of specific visual details is fragmented. They then retired to bed, experiencing a state between sleep and wakefulness.

Later, the participant woke up feeling high and experienced muscle spasms in their legs, which they monitored closely. These spasms affected individual muscle groups in sequence from the feet upwards but could be controlled with focus. The spasms ceased after about twenty minutes.

The next morning, the participant awoke feeling groggy and drained, noting a headache characteristic of smoking substance B. This state lasted for most of the day."
649,25660,"The individual sat alone at home and smoked a small amount of the substance, holding it in for about thirty seconds. They experienced typical physiological effects such as weak limbs and sweating, followed by a warped perception of reality. 

Suddenly, they found themselves observing their own body from an external perspective. Their lower body was melded into the wall behind them like a gargoyle. At the same time, there was a woman standing behind their left shoulder who appeared to be talking to them in a calm, lecturing tone. The participant had difficulty focusing and could not clearly understand what she said.

After an unknown duration, they found themselves lying across the room on the floor, curled up against a couch, with no memory of how they got there. They felt shaky but managed to regain composure and get up. The woman's presence was so vivid that the participant went outside to check if someone had actually visited while under the influence.

This experience was the strongest one reported by the individual, involving true hallucinations."
650,25176,"The participant describes two experiences with a substance. In the first instance, they smoked a small amount of the substance while in Amsterdam and were already stoned from cannabis use. They experienced mild visual sensations, feeling that their accumulated knowledge lined the inside of their skull thinly. This was followed by an uplifting thought about the vastness of knowledge one can acquire.

In the second experience, back home, the participant smoked a larger amount after having consumed some cannabis earlier in the day but not being stoned at the time. Initially, they experienced heightened visual perception and a hot/cold sensation on their skin. Their vision then became distorted, lacking texture and depth, with colors appearing flat like in cartoons.

The participant felt claustrophobic as walls seemed to close in around them, creating a narrow corridor-like space where they perceived themselves as two-dimensional. They also lost hearing and could not communicate effectively with the sitter, who was perceived as an evil cartoon character. The experience lasted about 20 minutes but left lasting psychological effects, including anxiety for several days.

After the intense visual distortions subsided, the participant felt a compulsion to move around but found that objects would alternate between real and cartoon-like representations, causing distress. They were eventually led through the house by the sitter, who tried to reassure them about their surroundings."
651,25166,"The individual smoked an unnamed substance for the first time outdoors in a secluded area of their driveway. Upon inhaling, they initially felt no effect but soon noticed ripples in space around distant trees. As the effects intensified, beads of sweat appeared on their forehead and they experienced a serene, peaceful feeling. They laughed uncontrollably and observed that their arm was wiggling as if made of rubber. The individual struggled to stand due to an invisible force field holding them down but eventually managed to walk back towards their house with some difficulty. The effects lasted approximately 15 minutes before gradually subsiding."
652,7340,"The participant prepared for the experience through relaxation exercises, rituals, and meditation before consuming the substance. They perceived a world slightly out of vibration with normal human perception where our world was created every instant by 'beings'. The beings were not clearly described but conveyed that humans are never truly alone. The participant felt presences around them manipulating everything to keep it running and sensed a chaotic order they were part of preserving. There was an entity, almost sentient, near the participant which pulled them apart in strange directions with strings connected to them. This experience left the participant feeling able to manipulate their own energy more effectively for some time after the initial effects subsided."
653,22822,"The participant smoked a substance and experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. They felt as if they were in another world that overlaid the real one. During the experience, they saw abstract visuals and stripes pulling through them. The participant also described being in what seemed like a school hallway with windows. Santiago, the sitter, was present throughout the trip and played an important role by supporting the participant."
654,22702,"The participant began their experience in a relaxed setting with close friends, lighting candles and playing music before smoking the substance from a pipe. Initially, they felt disconnected from reality and described seeing glimpses of another universe. A flame appeared, which recreated their physical body and caused intense tingling sensations.

After a break, they smoked again, this time experiencing a cartoonish, polygonal space between them and their friends. As the effects wore off, they realized where they were but appreciated the morphing effect. They then took a larger dose, leading to an intense experience where they lunged forward, grabbed their friends, and babbled incoherently.

In this state, they perceived time as a blanket that trapped them, causing them to fall into a white room with industrial machinery. They felt their life was like a TV show and experienced deep loss and guilt. Two blurry figures appeared before them but changed into the faces of their friends when recognition set in. The participant expressed immense happiness at seeing them again."
655,18058,"The participant consumed an extract from a plant and harmala alkaloids, then smoked salvia 10X and another substance. They experienced visual distortions where flat surfaces were covered in static symbols while objects with depth had changing patterns based on proximity. After smoking the substances, they felt intense physical sensations like being scorched by chemical fire and sweating profusely. Their vision became a chaotic dance of repeating symbols and patterns moving in various directions. The participant reported an overwhelming feeling that their surroundings were also themselves, slippery and dark, with no recognizable images or illusions to trace. They described the need to find new ways to perceive reality after all known handholds crumbled into vapor."
656,13267,"The participant prepared a substance from p.viridis leaf with harmala seeds and consumed it along with their friend. They experienced visual patterns and reached a peak state after about 30 minutes. Following this, they smoked salvia 10X through a bong. During the salvia experience, the individual perceived impossible angles and felt as though they had entered another dimension with more than 360 degrees. This lasted for approximately five minutes. Afterward, the participant sat stunned for about thirty minutes before tripping again on ayahuasca. They listened to music by Sigur Ros and experienced intense emotions including happiness, awe, and gratification."
657,14956,"The individual began their experience in a tranquil outdoor setting at sunset, accompanied by their partner, dog, and various wild animals. They smoked a substance through a pipe for about 4 minutes, taking large inhalations each held for nearly 20 seconds. After the sixth or seventh hit, they entered an altered state characterized by intense laughter followed by irritability towards usually peaceful sounds and sensations.

During this period, they experienced heightened sensitivity to their surroundings, finding even minor noises like a dog's collar bell extremely irritating. The ground beneath them also became uncomfortable as they noticed every detail of the dirt and debris. Fits of laughter alternated with moments of awareness about being under the influence.

Physical effects included sweating, increased heart rate, skin irritation, difficulty focusing eyes, and concentrating. Mentally, gravity felt distorted, similar to a mild roller coaster ride, and there was slight confusion. The experience lasted around an hour, during which they felt relaxed but lethargic, with heightened feelings of sexual attraction. Depression set in about 20 minutes after the initial trip and lasted another 20 minutes before resolving quickly.

No specific entities were communicated with or interacted with during this particular trip."
658,5407,"During the third experience, the participant felt intense tingling sensations in their sides and forehead, creating a triangular pressure sensation pushing them down. They perceived a large black woman on a patio with orange tiled flooring and geometric patterns, who leaned close to their face and said something along the lines of ""you're not supposed to be here."" The participant became very uncomfortable and decided to go for a walk outside, but returned briefly to retrieve a coat before leaving again.

While walking in the forest, the pressure sensation diminished somewhat. The participant expressed emotional discomfort and fear about losing their sense of self and ego dissolution. They reflected on their drug use progression and realized they had been moving too fast without proper reverence. This realization was prompted by an unpleasant experience with the substance rather than a gentle guidance."
659,4100,"The participant describes using an unnamed substance to aid in meditation. Their preferred setting is a darkened, calm environment where they sit cross-legged or recline in a chair. The method of consumption involves dripping tincture onto extract and smoking it with a pipe. They typically take one initial inhalation followed by deeper ones if desired.

The experience begins with a calm, mentholated tingling sensation that feels heavy on the body. Using an enriched 5x extract rather than a 10x extract provides a pleasant, light feeling. The participant sometimes engages in deep breathing to enhance absorption of the substance.

Occasionally, they feel as though the substance is showing them how to manipulate their spirit body's shape. In one instance, this involves rolling up like a Persian carpet; in another, unfolding like a wing. They refer to these experiences as meditation due to the focused state and prolonged altered consciousness after initial effects fade."
660,3642,"The participant began by taking a small dose which produced heavy body sensations and a feeling of partial disconnection from reality, particularly noticeable in the upper body. After waiting ten minutes, they took a larger dose (approximately double the initial amount). This led to intense effects almost immediately after inhalation. The participant felt their hands were stuck to the house and observed that part of their arm had blended into the house seamlessly.

They then experienced sitting simultaneously under the ground, on the side wall, and on the roof of a glass box, with others visible both above and below them. This was accompanied by a strong sense of déjà vu and familiarity. The participant closed their eyes again and entered a flat grey plane where they sensed an entity's presence but did not fully interact with it.

Upon reopening their eyes, reality felt overwhelming, leading to brief returns to the grey plane before coming back to consensual reality. The experience lasted about 4-5 minutes according to others present, though the participant perceived it as longer. They reported feeling weary and heavy for an hour after the trip, eventually recovering enough to drive safely two hours later."
661,3451,"The participant was alone in their house and decided to use a substance for a thrill-seeking experience. They smoked a large amount of the substance and felt the effects come on quickly. The trip caused them to feel like they were no longer themselves but another entity with its own motives. As reality slipped away, they walked towards the basement stairs but do not remember climbing them because the trip took over completely.

In the void, the participant saw a spine-like structure made of horizontal blue bars moving like a Chinese dragon. They felt an intense desire to join this essence of reality and tried to reach it but could not. A geometric abstraction then reached out towards them. The participant suddenly found themselves back in their kitchen, still feeling the urge to be somewhere else.

Five seconds later, they realized what was happening and began laughing at the diversity of experiences available. They described the trip as a whole new mode of existence and felt that fear was impossible during this experience. The trip lasted about one minute for them, which is shorter than other reported experiences with the substance."
662,3134,"The participant smoked Salvia at around 12:30 AM and initially felt no effects. After taking larger hits, they experienced intense coughing and laughing uncontrollably. They reported feeling as if they were spinning on a cosmic ferris wheel and saw bright carnival lights, people in line, and the decorations of the ferris wheel cars. The participant also mentioned seeing their parents watching them laugh hysterically. During this time, they felt out of control and had difficulty maintaining physical posture. After about five minutes (felt like thirty seconds), with some effort, they regained a sense of control and stood up. They described the overall experience as intense and intriguing."
663,2679,"Kathleen began experiencing altered perceptions after inhaling an unspecified substance. Initially, she felt disoriented and giggly but could still communicate. After a second inhalation, her memory of events became hazy. She perceived herself standing in front of Paul, who was on the floor collecting remnants of dried leaves.

In her mind's eye, Kathleen saw a vast cliff face composed of thousands of miniature versions of Paul, all laughing and mimicking her laughter. These entities were described as living and breathing duplicates that spiraled off each other like elements of the Mandelbrot set. The room around them appeared to be breaking down into pixelated squares.

Kathleen realized these entities weren't actually Paul but had used his form because he was present when she entered their realm. They demonstrated their power by transforming her living room into an alien jungle scene with waterfalls and exotic plants. Despite feeling a sense of self, Kathleen understood that her previous life no longer existed in this new reality.

The entities continued to laugh as they showed Kathleen various scenes, including the transformation back to her lounge when she wished it. This ability to change environments amused her but also made her feel angry and scared because these miniature Pauls were everywhere, even on the edges of her vision.

Kathleen tried to get rid of them by moving to the bedroom with Paul's help, but they persisted. She felt a mix of fear and relief as she realized this experience would eventually end. When normalcy returned, Kathleen expressed immense gratitude for her boyfriend and life, despite the initial terror."
664,1740,"The participant began their session in a dimly lit room with gentle rain music playing through headphones. After several inhalations, they experienced a sudden loss of bodily awareness while remaining conscious of their actions. Upon taking a final hit, they entered an altered state where they perceived themselves as an elderly person on a porch, watching rain and feeling calm and relaxed.

In this new reality, the participant felt immersed in the environment, sensing the cool breeze and smelling the forest around them. They then encountered an old woman who communicated telepathically, advising them to let go of their thoughts and relax. The encounter with the woman was vivid and felt real, complete with sensory details like raindrops on their face.

The experience shifted again as the old woman walked into a lush, vibrant forest, leaving the participant with an electric sensation before they gradually returned to their physical surroundings. Upon regaining awareness, the participant felt puzzled about whether they were back in reality or still within the altered state. They had to physically interact with objects to confirm their return to the physical world.

The journey was described as intense and highly dissociative, leaving a lasting impression on the participant's perception of reality and consciousness."
665,4319,"The participant sat in a redwood forest at night between four large trees near a stream. They used an unnamed substance and experienced visual and sensory phenomena. Initially, they perceived their body as an energy reservoir leaning against what felt like an even larger energy reservoir - the tree behind them. The participant felt connected to the roots of the trees, which extended deep into the earth and laterally towards other nearby trees. These trees were described as silent witnesses, ancient, and neutral in demeanor.

The experience then shifted inward, with the participant visualizing their spine as a hollow column of energy ending at the coccyx area. This visualization was accompanied by vivid colors within the column. After this internal exploration, the participant emerged from the trance-like state and offered incense to one of the trees as a gesture of gratitude before leaving the forest."
666,939,"The participant began by smoking small amounts of dried leaves from an unknown plant, experiencing a mild intoxication that passed quickly. Over subsequent days, they increased the dosage, adding fortified leaf to achieve stronger effects. During one session, they felt as if entering another world while still conscious and experienced auditory hallucinations.

In a later session with a larger dose, the participant reported a sudden onset of intense disorientation, feeling detached from reality. They perceived themselves as smoke floating above their body and became confused about their identity and surroundings. The user associated the smoking apparatus with Sesame Street muppets and felt they had committed an act that would lead to trouble.

The experience included feelings of being part of a larger metaphysical existence and understanding reality as a game manipulated by unseen beings. The participant expressed fear and embarrassment, hiding paraphernalia in their room as if evading authority figures. As the effects wore off, the user felt shaken but relieved to return to familiar surroundings."
667,3425,"The participant took three doses of a concentrated tincture sublingually over eight minutes. Initially, they felt physical sensations such as mouth numbness and tingling in the leg. Mentally, they experienced an introspective state where internal thoughts and memories were amplified while external stimuli became less prominent. The experience was described as difficult to put into words. They attempted various mental exercises during this period but found it challenging to focus on tasks requiring logical thinking or physical coordination. After about 45 minutes, the participant felt discomfort from prolonged internal amplification and tried to sleep. They woke up peacefully after a short nap and experienced a lingering feeling of undirected weirdness upon waking."
668,3037,"The participant felt an invisible weight skewing their perception of reality to the left and down, with darkness filling out their right side. They experienced coldness despite sweating profusely and confusion with memory loss. The participant saw a grey alien whose face was reflected in its pale insect eyes. This encounter caused panic and mental static before fading into battered coherence.

The individual also assisted another person who consumed the same substance. This second person hallucinated an alien attempting to steal their soul, experienced twitching confusion, and felt weighed down by something unpleasant."
669,2167,"The participant experienced three distinct hallucinations after consuming an unknown substance and Salvia. In the first hallucination, they found themselves on an infinitely long suburban street with green fences and mailboxes stretching out endlessly. There was a strong gravitational pull centered around their jaw, which caused a sensation of being stuck in a cosmic yawn. The participant felt as if they could see 360 degrees but had difficulty opening their eyes.

In the second hallucination, the individual found themselves at what appeared to be a bus stop with stained-glass and mosaic elements. They were a businessman impatiently waiting for a train or bus that never arrived. The sensation of gravity was centered around their knees due to tightly crossed legs. In the third hallucination, they felt squeezed flat like tape in a dispenser and became an n-dimensional mobius creature."
670,2152,"The participant began by preparing a bowl with old leaf material recommended for use with an unspecified plant. After smoking three large tokes rapidly, the effects came on quickly. The individual experienced a deep tingling sensation spreading from head to limbs, causing them to collapse onto a pillow in a state similar to that of a corpse.

As the experience progressed, the participant felt as if they were dying and their consciousness was separating from their body. They had fleeting fears about physical safety but these gave way to a deeper understanding of what it might mean to die. The presence of friends and family seemed to pull them back towards consciousness.

Gradually, the individual began to recover, sitting up briefly before lying down again with headphones on to block out external noises. In this state, they experienced intense auditory hallucinations characterized by a complex, multiharmonic hum that resonated throughout their body, particularly in the spine. This sensation felt like an influx of energy and lasted for about five minutes.

Afterwards, the participant sat up feeling mostly 'down' but still experiencing a pleasant low-level tingling. They interacted with others online without significant issues and felt fine overall."
671,753,"The participant prepared their environment by lighting scented candles, spreading a blanket, and playing Native American music before smoking half a leaf from a plant in a water pipe. After inhaling the smoke, they experienced uncontrollable laughter for about three minutes due to the perceived humor in the background music.

Four minutes after the second hit, the participant became semi-coherent and decided to smoke another half-leaf in a darkened room. This led to an intense experience where their sense of self dissolved, and they felt as if they were observing themselves from outside their body. They saw complex visualizations that included dimensions beyond comprehension and had fleeting thoughts about sex and reality.

The participant became unsure whether their life was real or not and wanted to return to a familiar state. After the experience, they dictated what they had seen to their girlfriend while still feeling its effects. The aftermath left them confused and seeking comfort from their partner."
672,104107,"The participant prepared for a drug trip by ingesting an oral tincture of Salvia. The initial sensation was intense burning under the tongue, which subsided after 30 seconds. They held the substance in their mouth for 15 minutes before swallowing it. Afterward, they experienced altered perceptions and visions while lying on their bed with closed eyes.

The participant saw a representation of their life as a pagoda-like structure. When receiving a text message about an event cancellation, part of the roof exploded, and a strange fist emerged to rebuild the structure, symbolizing external forces reshaping aspects of their life. They perceived this vision as normal rather than realizing it was due to the drug's effects.

The experience also included visions suggesting that past, present, and future were interconnected in an infinite space where lives are created by themselves and others before being experienced in the current reality. The participant felt a sense of revelation similar to their previous DMT experience but noted differences in the visual and emotional aspects of each trip.

Overall, the experience was prolonged, insightful, and not overwhelming for the participant, who found it valuable for spiritual reflection."
673,78400,"The participant and friends went to a beach where they purchased a substance. On their first attempt, using a corncob pipe, the effects were harsh but did not produce the desired ""trip."" A week later, they tried again with a higher potency dose, still using a corncob pipe, but experienced similar disappointing results.

On another occasion, while driving to a mall and smoking marijuana in a bubbler, the participant suggested combining it with the substance. After inhaling, the participant saw swirling colors of yellow, red, and orange, feeling flattened to their seat as if in another dimension. Everything appeared cartoon-like and two-dimensional, with dull colors. The participant felt that everything was fake and against them.

The participant's friend mentioned seeing skulls earlier but did not elaborate further on this experience. The participant became paranoid, questioning the reality of their surroundings and friends. They imagined being trapped in a ""tron like world"" inside a tunnel of yellow and red light. Physical sensations included feeling held down and struggling with an imaginary force (later realized to be the seat belt).

After about 25 minutes into the trip, the participant began asking if others felt the same way. Upon arriving at the mall, they started to see familiar stores but still had doubts about reality. The afterglow lasted well into the night until falling asleep at 2 AM."
674,115130,"The individual began their experience by consuming a combination of substances, including salvia divinorum, DXM, nitrous oxide, and tobacco. Over the course of several hours, they experienced multiple trips with increasing intensity due to reverse tolerance. During these experiences, they felt like various geometric shapes such as lines, grids, cubes, and points.

The participant interacted with an entity referred to as ""Salvia Sister,"" who appeared to be a guiding figure. Salvia Sister communicated that the individual had permission to be there and acknowledged their slight fear. The person also experienced multiple instances of ""waking up"" from the trips but could not determine if these were real or part of the experience.

In one state, they felt like a god, aware of being aware, and perceived an explosion of life within themselves, imagining it as the creation of universes. They saw millions of people living inside them, celebrating in ecstasy. The individual also believed they were guiding others through their trips and that people looked to them for answers.

The experience was prolonged, with a subtle salvia influence lasting throughout. After several hours, the participant began to feel frustrated by repeatedly ""waking up"" from what they thought were trips but were actually periods of sobriety. The next morning, while still under the influence of DXM and reflecting on their experiences, they felt unusually connected to their coworkers during a work call."
675,70580,"The participant experienced intense visual effects after inhaling smoke from a water pipe containing a plant material. Initially, they perceived their peripheral vision shaking violently before being launched into another reality. In this new space, they saw themselves in a third-person view, with their body suspended in mid-air while only the head remained connected to the original reality.

The participant encountered an entity resembling a woman intertwined with weeds and vines. The entity communicated that the participant was not fully mentally prepared for what was shown and advised them to be more ready next time. It also stated that perception shapes reality. After this interaction, the participant's perspective shifted back to first-person view as they were propelled through a dark tunnel lined with colorful fibers before regaining consciousness in their original environment.

Following the experience, the participant reported an afterglow of understanding and philosophical insight for several hours."
676,116976,"The participant began the experience by inhaling a substance from a bong filled with extract. Initially, they felt no effect but after a second hit, visual distortions occurred. The left side of their vision mirrored to the right, and an overwhelming pressure formed on their body. They saw Sam's face distorted into lines that extended infinitely and pulsated closer to the center of their vision.

As the experience progressed, the participant entered a white void where they felt one with the environment and experienced panic due to the loss of time perception. They then re-entered reality but felt like their physical actions were controlled by their subconscious. This led to an out-of-body experience where they watched themselves from a third-person perspective.

The participant also experienced rubber banding effects, looping through past moments before moving forward in time. To minimize these loops, the participant became quiet and moved little. They observed ants up close with heightened detail and felt amplified sensations while eating Gardettos. The after-effects included a foggy brain for days, questioning reality and feeling slightly lagged out."
677,116954,"The participant experienced two trips in their bedroom. During the first trip, they saw patterns distorting the kitchen as if viewed through a sine wave effect. They felt like they were swimming on the table top and perceived their friend's grin as mischievous. The floor seemed to roll them up, prompting them to seek help from their friend.

In the second trip, after inhaling more of the substance, the participant entered a state of blackness followed by a white room with an infinitely distant horizon. They encountered a wall representing thoughts that expanded with each word thought. Next, they were in a navy blue hallway with Roman-style columns and spired arch doorways leading to abysses.

The participant then saw hypercubes rotating in 4D space, each slice containing galaxies or universes. They felt an overwhelming sense of reality and a profound secret but couldn't share it without the universe ending. The room around them would swirl angrily when they considered sharing the knowledge. After letting go of the secret, the participant shouted ""Salvia is a Holy Drug!"" Reality continued to swirl before settling.

The entire second trip lasted seven minutes but felt like an eternity."
678,66210,"The participant and a friend (E) smoked a mixture containing an unnamed substance at around 6 PM. After two hits each, the participant experienced heavy legs that felt like stones before becoming lighter. E reported feeling his body differently but could not describe it well and mentioned the room spinning. They both laughed uncontrollably for about thirty seconds after which the effects wore off.

Later in the evening, they smoked a full bowl of the substance at around 9 PM. The participant walked in circles saying ""Hey, look. I'm walking on [substance]."" They then perceived a six-foot tall hill surrounding their table and cardboard cut-outs of people smiling at them about fifty feet away. E mentioned that only five minutes had passed while they felt it was much longer.

Back at the dorms around 9:30 PM, the participant suggested another bowl but E declined. The participant watched TV and saw themselves in a line with others asking for food from someone perceived as a mother figure. They laughed continuously while explaining this to E, who did not understand their words.

At about 1 AM, they returned to the park with two other people. After smoking another bowl, the participant looked at the river and laughed but could not recall much else except that they were told it felt like twenty seconds had passed when in fact five minutes had elapsed.

Around 3 AM back at the dorms, one of their friends smoked a whole bowl while the participant watched. The friend talked about being bitten by fire ants on his feet for two minutes and laughed hard, saying ""Those fire ants!"" He also mentioned that if he hadn't been bitten, he wouldn't have had anything to talk about seriously."
679,97464,"The individual smoked an unidentified substance from a large bowl, leading to immediate euphoria followed by a deep trance state. Upon awakening, they found themselves in what appeared to be a vast, otherworldly landscape where Earth was depicted as a small orb. A reptilian entity emerged from this orb and introduced itself through chanting: ""We are the thigh slappers!! You've come to have your thighs Slapped!!! We are the thigh Slappers!! You've come to have your thigh's slapped.""

The participant experienced intense physical sensations, feeling as though they were being ripped apart by the scales of the reptilian entity. They then found themselves at the bottom of a giant shoe, continuously smashed onto the small Earth-like orb.

Returning briefly to their room, the individual encountered cartoon versions of their friends and felt waves of energy emanating from them. The mother of the household, who was also their boss, appeared as a giraffe-like alien. Cash registers in this environment were spewing waves of energy, causing further discomfort.

At one point, the participant left their body and flew around the room like a happy child, exploring freely. They then entered another realm through a piece of art on the wall, experiencing themselves as three orbs floating in space connected by lines. This was followed by more intense sensations from their friends' faces before they finally returned to normalcy.

The experience lasted for an extended period, with the individual recalling only fragments such as the wavelengths produced by their friends and specific hallucinations like the giraffe-like alien and cash registers. They later recalled additional details including being sodomized by a dinosaur via television waves and the significance of a small grey dot that transported them between realities."
680,48252,"The participant and their friend prepared for an experience by researching and setting up a comfortable environment. The user inhaled the substance and felt disoriented initially. Intense visual patterns superimposed over objects in the room were observed, making it difficult to focus on surroundings. Discomfort with clothing and furniture led to fear and loss of control. As they came down from the experience, they engaged in activities like walking around and cleaning up to distract themselves. Afterward, they reflected on what they learned and expressed a willingness to try again but warned others about its potency."
681,82009,"The participant had a drug-induced experience in which they smoked a substance from a bong while listening to music. During the first part of the trip, Nick appeared to transform into a genie-like figure with a tail and was wearing a face mask. Words appeared on the wall behind him, shifting colors between red, green, and yellow. The participant felt their head rotating clockwise and experienced blackness with blue flashes.

In the second part of the experience, the participant was pulled into a wall and encountered millions of voices speaking an unfamiliar language. They were then transported to a dark forest with lightning but no thunder, where they saw unidentified animals and a red being holding a person's headless body. The participant tried to escape by jumping into holes in the ground or grabbing onto openings.

Eventually, the participant returned to the room and found it empty except for the bed. They yelled for help but received no response from Nick. After some time, they were brought back to the forest where the red being was now closer. The realization came that the person held by the red being was Nick with his head torn off.

The experience concluded with a swirl of colors and a voice repeating phrases until it became Nick's voice. Upon returning to reality, the participant was shaking and nearly in tears, unable to remember the trip for several hours afterward."
682,70332,"The individual reports experiencing various effects from the use of a substance. Their first experience was characterized by intense sensory distortion, including visual phenomena such as a rainbow shooting out of their chest, and auditory distortions. They felt as though they were being pulled out of the room, which caused initial panic. Subsequent experiences included euphoria and fun trips, but also more profound and sometimes unsettling effects like feeling their ego obliterated.

The user noticed that colors appeared brighter and contrasts sharper after using the substance for the first time. Over a year, they observed changes in perception and psychological states, including a diminished desire for alcohol. They have used different strengths of the substance, noting variations in physical sensations and duration of effects. The experiences often include elements such as death, helpers, spinning, stretching, lines, transformation into other things, loss of identity, other dimensions, and a membrane.

Music is also frequently experienced during these trips, including American Indian drumming, native African drumming, techno music, and vocal humming."
683,70412,"The participant reports using a substance twice over several days. During the first experience, they felt heaviness in their head and body, experienced sweating, and had visual sensations resembling a pinwheel or taffy machine motion. They repeated the process multiple times but did not achieve stronger effects. For the second session, they used a higher strength of the substance while listening to classical music and watching screen savers. The participant felt similar heaviness and visual sensations, describing them as swirling patterns and liquid-like merging movements. They were able to control their breathing and remained aware of time passing accurately throughout both experiences."
684,64761,"The narrator tried the substance for the first time at a friend's house along with two others. On the second attempt, after inhaling a large dose, they experienced enhanced vision, tingling sensations throughout their body, and an altered sense of self-space. The visual field became hazy, and the people present began to transform into comic book-like fruit forms: X as an apple, Y as grapes, and the narrator as a banana. An unknown woman appeared in the distance, carrying a shopping basket and eventually peeling the narrator like a banana, causing their vision to split and gradually return to normal reality.

The narrator felt extremely high for about ten minutes after the experience and attempted to explain what happened to their friends but found it difficult to convey effectively. They expressed a desire to try the substance again in a more spiritual setting with different companions and under better conditions."
685,116185,"The participant began by using a small amount of the substance in a water pipe after drinking beer to relax. They experienced sudden onset effects characterized by vivid, colorful, and intricate visual hallucinations. Initially, they saw snakelike objects crawling on the table's edges and top, which were described as pleasant and cartoonish.

The experience then shifted to include a clock hanging on the wall with twelve multi-colored balls moving through what appeared to be a fluid membrane, creating vibrant colors upon contact. The participant felt separated from reality by an invisible plane, yet everything was vividly clear.

Physical sensations included a vibratory feeling throughout their body and a sensation of being drawn backwards by gravity. They eventually lay down on the bed, feeling paralyzed and heavy, with arms unable to lift. After what seemed like a long time, they slowly regained normal vision and were able to sit up, then stand, though still feeling dizzy.

The experience lasted approximately ten minutes but felt much longer due to its intensity. The participant noted that while under the influence, emotions felt raw and real without the awareness of being ""under the influence."""
686,75804,"The participant describes their first encounter with the substance, noting its sudden and intense effects. Over several months, they refine their method of consumption, typically smoking three to four small hits over a period of time while lying down or sitting cross-legged on the floor. During one experience, they report feeling as though they were being folded in half but then falling out of their body into an extremely comfortable state. In front of them appears a female entity who communicates that previous uncomfortable experiences were tests and that they are now ready to enter another realm through a vortex-like door. The entity advises the participant to ingest the substance orally for further exploration."
687,75720,"The participant took a small dose of an extract substance with friends. They felt an entity named 'Thiingor' enter their body, demanding more control over them. Thiingor expressed interest in objects around the room and attempted to take control of the participant's motor skills and speech. The first dose was mild but still overwhelming; after a second bowl, Thiingor became aggressive and took full control of the participant's vocal cords and some motor functions. Thiingor explored items in the room, such as a wooden box and paintbrush, with curiosity. The experience included difficulty swallowing due to Thiingor's unfamiliarity with the action. After struggling for control, the participant regained dominance over their body and ended the trip by drinking juice."
688,73878,"The participant experienced three sessions with increasing doses of a substance. In the first session, they felt pins-and-needles sensations and slight visual changes but no significant effects. During the second session, an entity was perceived that personified sequences of actions rather than having a distinct form. This entity seemed to oversee the user's actions, leading to a sense of being a puppet. Visual perception became more acute, focusing on color differences in the environment. In the third and highest dose session, physical sensations were stronger, including disassociation from one's body and an enhanced awareness of motion and sound. The user felt as if they were part of a factory-line process, with actions carried out automatically. There was also a sense of being pulled by an unseen force, particularly on one side of the body. Visual perception remained heightened but did not include strong hallucinations."
689,109143,"The individual experienced rapid spinning visuals, followed by a flattening of their field of vision. They saw leaves magnified in color and size, creating an intense visual effect. The person then felt a falling sensation out of reality, reaching out to their friend for support. During this phase, they lost all memories of their life and identity, feeling as though they were on the edge of reality being pulled into another dimension.

The individual saw a tube-like vision with colorful rims surrounding a narrow band of clear sight. They perceived their friend holding them by the hand at the end of the tube. The visuals included a cartoonish sheriff figure made from orange leaves and morphing patterns. The person became angry, believing their friend was mocking them during this vulnerable state.

The individual then experienced relief as they realized they needed to accept the situation rather than fight it. They felt a return to reality with the world slowly expanding back into 3D vision. Upon regaining awareness, they were surprised by their surroundings and had difficulty remembering details of the experience. The person felt joyful and laughed frequently while gathering their thoughts.

Physical sensations included skin irritation and an intense desire for beer upon returning to normalcy."
690,115085,"The participant had multiple unsuccessful attempts at achieving effects from a substance before finally succeeding in a high-dose session. During this session, they experienced vivid visual and auditory hallucinations. They saw individual blades of grass appear as if on fire and felt an urge to talk with a ""bubbly"" voice. The autumn landscape came alive with telepathic voices, and the participant felt euphoria and excitement for life.

The participant then focused on a large oak tree that began glowing with deep yellow, orange, and purple flames. On top of this flame appeared two deep black eyes belonging to an old, wise entity. This entity opened into a bottomless pit where small stick figures spiraled down infinitely, hammering away at the walls of the pit.

Next, the participant entered what felt like an ancient underground cavern with rectangular stones that had blue eyes watching them. At the end of this cave was an infinite pit guarded by an ancient Roman-themed entity overseeing an execution. Two larger versions of the laboring stick people appeared and began downloading information into the participant's mind telepathically.

The participant questioned the entities' reality, to which they responded with indifference and provided a specific measurement (106 centimeters) for verification. The entities then explained that two blue laser beams powered all existence and consciousness throughout the universe. They invited the participant to grab onto one of these beams, which felt like sharp metal spikes piercing through their hands.

The participant held on as the beam shot through the universe at light speed, feeling the full power of the universe flowing through them. The experience ended with a cascade of bright electric molecules moving downwards through their vision for 2-3 minutes before fading away.

After the session, the participant sat down and reflected on the profound changes in their worldview and outlook on life."
691,115075,"The participant conducted three attempts at chewing dried Salvia divinorum over several weeks. 

First attempt: 
- Chewed approximately 5g of dried leaves.
- Experienced a slight delay when moving their head left and right, somewhat similar to a low-level cannabis high.
- No other significant effects were reported.

Second attempt:
- Chewed multiple doses totaling approximately 22.5g over about 3.5 hours.
- At around 10g, felt a light body load and slight delay when moving the head left and right.
- Around 12.5g, experienced visual distortions where the computer monitor appeared to rotate clockwise in a sawtooth motion while the room behind it rotated counterclockwise.
- At approximately 15g, perceived objects on their desk as extremely far away, with an arm feeling distant when used.
- Around 17.5g, felt surrounded by an ocean of trippiness, with the desk area acting like a life raft providing reassurance that they could return to baseline anytime.
- At around 20g, experienced the computer monitor feeling flatter than usual and a paper on the desk resembling a sign hanging above a store or off a cliff face.
- By 22.5g, felt extremely tired and went to bed.

Third attempt:
- Chewed approximately 5g of dried leaves.
- Experienced a slight delay when moving their head left and right, similar to the first attempt.
- No other significant effects were reported.

After all attempts, the participant noted severe dry mouth and a floating sensation with wobbly joints, similar to cannabis."
692,70378,"The participant began by smoking an unspecified substance in a dorm room setting, accompanied by a roommate acting as a sitter. They experienced initial visual distortions where everything appeared flat and was zipped together horizontally from left to right. This led them into another reality where they perceived themselves as a black person living in a small town during the 1950s with a family. After about 15-30 minutes, they returned to their dorm room but continued experiencing visual distortions and sensory overload.

The participant attempted to interact with others in the room but struggled to recognize them or communicate effectively. They experienced intense hallucinations including green mushroom-shaped bristles coming out of fabric-like structures. Sensory experiences such as feeling hot and sweating were heightened, making simple actions like removing a hoodie challenging due to overwhelming sensations.

Interactions with the roommate included periods of confusion and anger, with the participant expressing frustration at being asked questions that seemed irrelevant in their altered state. The experience lasted approximately 30 minutes, during which time the participant attempted to return to normalcy but found it difficult to do so without sensory distractions."
693,96336,"The participant began the experience by inhaling a large amount of an unspecified substance while sitting on their living room floor. Their heart rate was elevated before inhalation, and they had difficulty exhaling after taking it in. 

During the trip, the participant experienced a loss of ego and sense of self, entering what felt like a timeless state of awareness. They perceived themselves as part of a vast ocean of consciousness with tendrils connecting to other points. The experience was accompanied by intense visual perceptions and a feeling of oneness with others.

The participant's body contorted into strange positions during the trip, which they did not remember but their wife later described. As the effects wore off, the participant slowly regained awareness of their physical form, starting from pressure sensations around the forehead area. They gradually reconnected with their surroundings and realized they were in a relationship with their wife.

The experience lasted approximately 7-10 minutes according to the wife, though it felt much longer to the participant. Upon regaining full consciousness, the participant expressed fear of having lost their mind but later engaged in dialogue about the trip's revelations. They described feeling connected to all living beings and questioned the nature of reality, time, and individual identity."
694,72789,"The participant prepared a tincture of an unknown substance and experienced immediate discomfort upon ingestion, followed by vomiting. They felt transported to another dimension characterized by glass-like surfaces that made sounds when objects touched or feet hit the floor. The visual distortions included melting objects and fractal patterns on white surfaces.

In this altered state, they encountered a woman who lectured them about their understanding of her nature and warned against overconfidence. The participant also experienced pleasant, intense visuals while listening to music in a two-dimensional plane that changed with the phases of the music.

The trip lasted approximately 20 minutes before the participant dozed off and woke up feeling good the next morning. They did not gain any significant insights but noted the substance's intensity and strangeness without recreational 'high' effects."
695,11622,"The participant had two experiences with a substance: first, dried leaves smoked in a hookah, and second, an extract consumed through a pipe. In the initial experience, after smoking multiple bowls from the hookah, the participant felt as though they were being pulled towards the ceiling for about 10-20 seconds before returning to baseline.

In the second experience, the participant and two friends each took small doses of the substance through a pipe. The girlfriend experienced intense laughter lasting several minutes and reported feeling as if there should be a wall behind her where none existed. Another friend remained composed but also found the experience ""weird."" When the participant tried it themselves, they felt pushed and pulled around the room by an unseen force and noticed a yellow tint to their surroundings. They perceived the room as having an ""enchanted"" feel and felt mistrust towards others in the room.

Communication between participants was difficult, with words seeming to be misunderstood. The girlfriend suggested walking around but this seemed threatening to the participant. After coming down from the experience, which lasted about 5 minutes, the effects were hard to distinguish from normal reality for some time.

The friend who took multiple doses reported seeing tall grass on the floor and feeling like a lion in Africa during their trip, which lasted approximately 8 minutes."
696,114591,"The narrator and his friend prepared a homemade bong using plastic bottles and other materials, then smoked an extract of an unspecified substance. After inhaling, the narrator experienced visual hallucinations including rotating wheels and thought-rollers that represented his thoughts. He felt a sense of detachment from reality but remained aware of his surroundings.

They decided to try again with a smaller dose. The narrator inhaled and began experiencing more intense visuals, including what he perceived as an emerald aura dancing around him. He interacted with this entity, which he believed was associated with the substance they were using, asking it questions about God and love. During this interaction, he felt a sense of infinite maternal love.

The experience concluded with the narrator feeling at peace but slightly annoyed by an unexpected phone call from someone who had dialed the wrong number."
697,87364,"The participant had three experiences with a substance on the same night. In the first experience, they felt a pressure pushing against them and described it as something moving towards them, almost like being run over by a steamroller. This effect subsided in less than 10 minutes, leaving them feeling high.

In the second experience, time ceased to have meaning for the participant. They perceived reality unfolding like pages in a book and felt they had reached an 'edge' of reality. The participant experienced sadness and saw their actions from outside their body. They also expressed seeing the future and expecting to see someone far away. During this trip, the participant loudly exclaimed ""It's real, I see it, it's real!"" while pounding on a table.

In the third experience, the participant reached a similar place as in the second experiment but found it less disconcerting. They had very little recollection of this trip other than visiting the same space as before."
698,71314,"The individual sat on the floor with a glass bubbler filled with the substance and smoked it twice. After the second hit, they experienced intense visual hallucinations where the room appeared to melt into darkness, and objects like lamps reached out to them telepathically offering comfort. They then entered a state of vivid imagery involving colorful, writhing organisms resembling alphabetic runes and sound components. These organisms were perceived as forming words, with the word ""FUCK"" being examined in detail.

The participant felt they had entered an endless space between words and experienced panic when trying to return to their body, which appeared to be sitting still while they moved around. They became increasingly paranoid, believing everyone was in on a joke and that someone would burst through the door angrily. The individual saw a mysterious van outside and feared it might belong to people who had tricked them.

During this time, they experienced confusion about reality, such as seeing characters on TV pull out scripts for help with their lines. They ran outside to check if anyone had been hit by a car but found no one there. After returning inside, the participant called their girlfriend and felt drowsy and warm while watching trees breathe in sync with them."
699,85785,"The participant began the experience feeling calm and confident after a day of family activities. They entered a room resembling an interview setting, bathed in light, which made them feel strong and confident. During another dose, they experienced a peak where they saw a beautiful face staring into theirs, likely representing the plant itself. This encounter brought feelings of love and self-love. The participant also interacted with characters referred to as ""the Leaves,"" who were aspects of the plant or themselves. These interactions were described as intimate but distant.

The experience included scenes such as hovering above a group around a campfire in what felt like a sacred place, and confusion about chronology. Upon returning to normal reality, everything seemed slightly cartoonish. The participant wrote down their thoughts during this period, feeling that the plant was guiding them. They carried some dried plant material with them for the job interview, which helped maintain calm focus and confidence.

The experience lasted approximately an hour but felt both longer and shorter. It had a positive impact on the participant's subsequent job interviews and employment status."
700,73050,"The individual experienced intense visual and auditory distortions after consuming an unknown substance. Initially, they felt anxious and disoriented, unable to recognize their surroundings or understand what was happening. They perceived themselves as part of a giant rotating wheel with other people on it, all moving in time with music. The experience became increasingly overwhelming, with the participant feeling as though everything was spiraling into a drain, leading to an existential crisis.

The individual could see the fabric of space and time warping around them, with the earth curling inward towards a central point. They felt stretched and flattened out into a single dimension, believing it was the end of all existence. The people on the wheel were expressing fear and distress. The participant tried to communicate but found it difficult.

As the experience progressed, they began to question their reality and the nature of existence itself. They thought about their life and loved ones, wondering if they would ever see them again. Just as they were about to be pulled into darkness, they regained awareness of their surroundings. They were sitting on a couch in an apartment, drenched in sweat.

The experience lasted several minutes before the participant fully came down. They expressed amazement at the intensity and duration of the trip, which they attributed solely to the substance consumed."
701,114191,"The participant experienced intense physical and perceptual changes after smoking an unknown substance in a college dorm room setting. Initially, they felt a strong spinning sensation that made it difficult to recognize familiar objects. Visual distortions included flashing strips of purple light and chaotic movement of objects around them. The participant reported losing sense of self and reality.

During the experience, an entity appeared next to the participant and said, ""You exist again."" This entity explained that the participant had been in a state of existence intertwined with a nonexistent realm. The entity described themselves and others as similar entities arranged at the boundary between these realms, capable of manipulating existence from the nonexistent realm.

The entity demonstrated this ability by causing objects on a table to fold and expand in unusual ways. The experience felt timeless, and the participant was content with their new understanding of reality. Eventually, they returned to normal awareness but were left in shock and happiness about the encounter."
702,107879,"The participant describes three experiences with an unnamed substance. The first time, about five years ago, their reality dissolved into a static energy field, but they remember little of the middle part of the experience. In the second and third trips, conducted recently in a bathroom setting alone, the world again dissolved into a crackling energy field that distorted and jumped back to normal. During these experiences, the participant encountered entities with Yorkshire accents who spoke to them in a friendly manner.

In the second trip, the participant found themselves as a baby god on a grass lawn surrounded by a playpen-like area. The entities, described as ""mum"" and ""dad"" gods, asked if they wanted to continue playing or return to normal reality. They assured the participant that there was no need to be scared and that they could stay as long as they liked.

In the third trip, the participant found themselves in a village being pushed along in a pram by an old man on a bicycle. The old man spoke about the place being familiar and mentioned the participant's desire to return and tell others about it.

The experiences also included physical sensations such as sharp buzzing energy felt throughout the body, particularly in the teeth, which was described as unpleasant but not painful."
703,96055,"The experience began in a walk-in closet with three friends. After inhaling several hits of an extract, the individual's perception transformed into an orb descending into black eternity, containing their reality and friends within it. Voices from outside became fractalized, emanating from separate orbs. The participant perceived themselves as part of a ""reincarnation machine,"" where each pixel represented a lifetime revolving around mundane tasks like buying cigarettes.

The experience included several reincarnations into different lifetimes, all centered on the quest for cigarettes in various mundane settings. After these experiences, the individual attempted to return to their body but instead found themselves merging with an expanding candle flame, causing fear and disorientation. They eventually managed to regain control and returned to reality, though initially feeling disconnected from the world."
704,98245,"The participant began by feeling heightened senses and slow, jerky movements after taking two tokes from a pipe filled with 10x extract. They lay down on their bed and closed their eyes, experiencing a pulling sensation around their head. Their consciousness drifted between reality and another dimension, where they felt like an entity waking up or falling down in an epic yet familiar realm. As the effects began to wane, this higher dimensional realm started to disappear from view, leaving them with a peculiar and alienating feeling of returning to their body lying on the bed."
705,69663,"The participant and their roommate consumed a substance together at home. After inhaling a large dose of the substance, the participant felt drawn backward into their chair and lost touch with reality before hitting the floor. Upon regaining consciousness, they found themselves lying on a black rug with geometric designs in what seemed like a dark hallway.

In this hallucinatory state, the participant saw a two-dimensional room that began to roll over them. Familiar yet strange people appeared in the room, and the participant felt as if they were about to disappear without pain but with a sense of unfinished business. The floor started curling up towards the far end of the room, resembling a carpet being rolled away.

The participant tried to stand but was unable to due to intense gravity pulling them down. They asked the entities why they were rolling up the apartment and throwing it away, to which the entities replied that this action was happening globally and was completed. The participant felt fear and attempted to investigate but could not move their mouth or legs.

After coming back to reality, the participant stood up and found their roommate looking at them with concern. It took several minutes for the participant to remember they had consumed the substance and were still confused about the experience even after it ended."
706,113218,"The experience began with visual distortions of wave-like patterns moving towards the participant. A dark voice emerged from behind the fireplace, commenting on the use of music during the experience. After redosing, stronger effects set in: a woody taste in the mouth, melting into surfaces, and loss of spatial awareness. The room became complex and flattened with some 3D objects appearing as 2D.

The participant saw beings in another room who wanted them to come further into the trip for play but felt unable due to insufficient dosage. These beings were described as parent-like, one male and one female. There was a desire to go deeper into the experience, possibly leading to utter blackness, but this was resisted by the beings.

The sitter's presence became overwhelming and unpleasant, causing frustration and preventing further progression in the trip. The participant wanted to lay down on the floor but felt constrained by the sitter watching. They asked the beings if they would speak again, which they did not do verbally but communicated a desire for closer interaction.

After effects were brief, with feelings of lightness and loss of time gone within 90 minutes."
707,71957,"The participant prepared an extract of Salvia divinorum using ethanol and dried leaves, resulting in a 10x concentration. They used a homemade vaporizer setup to inhale the substance, experiencing rapid onset effects after the second draw. The experience was characterized by intense visual distortions, fractal patterns, and a sense of detachment from reality. The participant felt as though they were being pulled into another dimension through a current running up from one corner of the room.

During the experience, there was an ongoing struggle with paranoia and a feeling of being the butt of a cosmic joke. Despite this, the participant became increasingly aware of something important that seemed just out of reach. Each hit felt longer in duration than the previous one, with time perception becoming distorted. The experience peaked during the sixth hit but was abruptly interrupted by the entry of the participant's girlfriend into the room.

After the interruption, the participant experienced a residual detachment and slight visual distortions for several minutes before feeling an overwhelming sense of emptiness. This was followed by a mix of exhaustion and renewed energy."
708,113217,"The participant sat down at their dining room table, smoked a small amount of extract, and experienced visual hallucinations within 20-30 seconds. Reality appeared to undulate in wavelike patterns and was made up of circular protrusions on every surface. The participant saw a dark evil force at the end of a corridor that seemed to strip away these protrusions as it moved closer. There was also a vague female presence described as motherly with purple light around her. During the trip, the participant lost their sense of self and had thoughts about the person who took the substance and their motives for doing so. The trip lasted approximately 10 minutes before ending when the heating system shut off. After effects included feeling light-headed and having a distorted sense of time for about an hour."
709,100892,"The participant describes a powerful experience with a substance that initially produced mild effects such as suggestible visuals and a surreal atmosphere. However, on this occasion, the effects were much stronger, causing them to feel as though they had entered an alien dimension. They experienced rapid visual changes, feeling like an atom-wide rag doll tumbling within an immense dryer. The environment was perceived as hostile, with every surface layered in strange glyphs resembling math or alien symbols. There was a sense of complete and utter loneliness and the realization that they had no control over their fate. This terrifying episode lasted for several minutes before subsiding."
710,112421,"The account describes a drug trip experience involving three individuals who smoked an extract of a substance. One person initially tried smoking a small amount but only experienced mild effects such as pressure in their head and narrowed vision. A few days later, the same individual and another friend purchased a stronger extract of the substance.

The second friend reported seeing grass-like creatures that rose from the soil and communicated telepathically with her to sit still on her porch until the drug wore off. The next day, all three friends went to a forest where two of them smoked a mixture of the substance and marijuana. One person became extremely disoriented, laughing uncontrollably, and repeatedly placed items in different pockets. Another friend experienced intense physical discomfort, falling back onto the ground and struggling to move or speak coherently.

The first individual then smoked about 2.5 times as much of the pure substance compared to the others. They immediately felt a strong onset of effects including throat pain, temporary blindness in peripheral vision, extreme lightheadedness, and visual distortions where their field of view was split into two halves with colorful patterns on the sides. The individual struggled to move or speak and experienced intense anxiety.

After some time, they regained partial control over their body but were still unable to look away from a water bottle in front of them, as if magnetically drawn towards it. They sat criss-crossed with arms outstretched for an extended period before eventually falling back and expressing fear and discomfort. A friend held the individual's head in her lap while trying to calm them down.

The aftermath included feelings of numbness and emotional detachment from the world. The participant experienced amnesia, unable to recall events that occurred during or immediately after the trip until friends recounted what happened."
711,71940,"The participant experienced two sessions with a substance that caused intense psychological effects. During the first session, the participant became confused about their identity and surroundings, believing they were part of the couch they were lying on. They patted at the blanket, trying to understand what was attached to them. After the initial confusion wore off, the participant felt a stoned-like state with slight mental cloudiness.

In the second session, the participant again became confused about their identity and surroundings but was more lucid than in the first experience. They believed they were part of the bed they were lying on and attempted to identify their body parts by patting at lumps beneath them. The participant concluded that there were legs under the blankets but was unsure if this was correct.

After both sessions, the participant felt mentally foggy but physically fine."
712,87594,"The individual experienced a profound alteration in perception after consuming a substance. Initially, they felt disoriented and anxious, unable to recognize their surroundings or understand what was happening. They perceived themselves as part of a giant rotating wheel with other people on each spoke. The environment appeared colorful and dynamic, pulsating and flashing in time with the music playing.

As the experience progressed, the individual became increasingly distressed, believing they were witnessing the end of everything spiraling into a drain. They felt stretched and flattened out, coming to the realization that all existence was part of this machine-like process. The people around them appeared fearful as well.

The participant could see a ""Google Earth"" view of planet earth curling inward towards the center, resembling fabric being twisted by a knife. They tried to communicate with Robert, who had a knowing smile and seemed unperturbed by the experience. The individual felt that Robert had orchestrated this event and was destined to meet him for this purpose.

As the experience neared its end, the participant's right foot began to disappear, followed by their leg. Their phone sounded distorted before going silent as it flattened out of existence. They eventually regained awareness in Robert's apartment, drenched in sweat and shocked by what had transpired.

After coming down from the experience, they expressed amazement that such an intense trip was caused by a single bong hit. The participant stated they would do it again but with more preparation and familiarity with their surroundings."
713,111829,"The individual had two experiences with a psychedelic substance. In the first experience, they felt a sudden rush after inhaling the substance, leading to visual distortions and body dissociation. They perceived an entity inside their brain during this trip and communicated with it in a hallucinatory manner. The second experience occurred outdoors with a sibling, where the individual experienced similar effects but focused more on personal realization rather than intense visuals."
714,102632,"The participant consumed a substance in tea form on two occasions. During the first session, they experienced racing thoughts that led to an insight about childhood embarrassment being linked to their current anxiety. The second session was more vivid, involving visualizations and interactions with entities. In this experience, the participant saw themselves walking towards a dark room where something was growing from their back, described as antlers or coral-like structures extending from shoulder blades to upper thighs. A woman with a southern accent approached, expressing concern about the burden that had attached itself to the participant's body due to prolonged focus on it. She instructed a large man to remove the growth, which resulted in severe physical damage to the back and buttocks of the participant's body. The couple continued to follow the participant as they walked forward, with the woman warning them not to look back at the detached growth. After this experience, the participant did not sleep well but felt that these insights were helpful in understanding their anxiety."
715,69665,"The participant smoked one hitter pack of a potent extract and immediately felt psychedelic effects. They noticed colorful, contoured patterns on their friends and surroundings, similar to Alex Grey's artwork. The auditory experience was altered, with music sounding transformed into a pseudo-techno version. The participant became aroused and attempted to make out with their girlfriend but sat down due to the intensity of the drug.

A masculine voice communicated that the participant should not be there while drunk and advised them to return when sober. This communication seemed to come from an entity rather than a person, as no words were spoken aloud. In the bedroom, the participant experienced waves of intense effects and then felt a mind jab, which they attributed to their pet lizard awakening them.

The participant's friend also tried the extract later and heard a voice telling him to remain seated, similar to the experience described by the first participant. The friend reported that standing up could have caused harm."
716,96306,"The participant was alone in their room during the afternoon when they decided to use a substance. They began by lying down on their bed and took a large hit from a bowl containing the substance. Shortly after, they experienced visual hallucinations where beams of sunlight appeared to have solid form and were slicing through them.

They then noticed swirling musical notes emanating from their laptop, which held their attention for an extended period. A female entity appeared in the center of the room, described as a feathery goddess. She communicated with the participant, asking if they wanted to see how everything worked and encouraging them to take another hit.

The bowl seemed to exert gravitational force on the participant, pulling them towards it. As they were pulled downwards, half their body was in their room while the other half entered an alternate world. The floor began to crack and open up into blackness. The participant resisted this pull and verbally expressed refusal multiple times.

This resistance upset the entity, who questioned why the participant had summoned her if not wanting to learn from her. After apologizing, the floor closed, and the music resumed its beauty. The entity became more ghostly and white, pointing towards a window where the participant saw a large, translucent, chakra-like circle filled with spinning gears.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling that everything in reality fits together perfectly like puzzle pieces in a complex clockwork mechanism."
717,111882,"On the first day, the participant smoked a substance and experienced minor visual effects such as undulating fractal ribbons. They felt an uplifting mood but no significant hallucinations. The next day, after smoking again in similar conditions, they saw the same fractal ribbons which rapidly crossed each other. Their body became loose, and they perceived multiple layers of reality overlapping. Physical space appeared as symmetrical fractal pixels.

The participant then felt a presence of sentient beings that were not visible but seemed to be part of another layer of reality. They communicated with these entities and felt as if they had returned to a more familiar place. The entities appeared amused by the situation, leading the participant to laugh. As the experience progressed, the layers of reality became less intense, and the participant found themselves in a transitional space between dimensions.

Initially worried about being stuck in this state, the participant eventually accepted it and enjoyed music through earphones while dancing for 10-20 minutes. This activity helped them return to three-dimensional space. Upon returning to bed, they felt amused by their experience and the absurdity of their usual self and personality within a three-dimensional context."
718,88716,"The participant experienced heavy body sensations after inhaling the substance, making it difficult to move any part of their body below the head. They lost track of time and sensory input became confusing. Visual hallucinations included fractal-like patterns on a friend's face while driving, which replicated and spun off into long patterns before returning to normal. The participant felt an intense sense of wrongness when turning onto a road back to town.

The participant attempted to communicate their feelings but found it difficult due to the altered state. They perceived other passengers in the car as one-dimensional figures painted on a wall. After closing their eyes, they entered a dreamlike space filled with geometric shapes and fractals, where thoughts materialized into objects or people that morphed into something else.

The trip concluded when the vehicle pulled over back in town, but the participant continued to see fractal patterns when closing their eyes for the rest of the night."
719,55775,"The individual begins by experimenting with a small dose of an extract substance, experiencing mild effects. On the second attempt, they take a larger dose and immediately feel the onset of intense psychedelic effects. They perceive gnomes everywhere, though these entities are described as fuzzy shadows that can be seen through. The participant feels an irresistible force pulling on their veins, leading them to their bedroom where they lay down.

While lying in bed, the individual continues to experience visualizations of gnomes and a sense of being in a majestic kingdom. They report no color distortions but instead describe visualizations consistent with their mindset. Music played during this time is perceived as less interesting than the internal experiences. The trip lasts for about half an hour before the effects subside, leaving the participant without any lingering negative effects."
720,81100,"The participant volunteered to try a substance after an initial preparation session involving another plant. They smoked a pipe containing 10x base with 40x topping of the substance. The experience began abruptly, making them feel as if they were being pulled away from their life and reality. They saw fractals and an open expanse of water with a floating island and ships.

During this state, three people assisted the participant: a shaman and two friends. These individuals held the participant down while they struggled to stay in the dream-like state. The shaman's voice echoed through the fractal, urging them to calm down and accept the experience. When informed that they had just smoked salvia, the participant relaxed slightly but still felt heavy with its effects.

Afterwards, a woman sang a chant to help calm the participant, who was emotional and tearful. They managed to stand up and wandered off alone to contemplate their experience."
721,79730,"In the first experience, three individuals used a substance in small doses. The first user sat by the pool and experienced the water transforming into an animated world similar to Roger Rabbit's Toon Town. After about two minutes, they returned to normal but were slightly disoriented. The second and third users had similar experiences, though less intense than the first.

In the second experience with a higher potency substance, one user sat by the pool and felt everything peeling away like old paint, revealing darkness and a shadowy figure explaining that their entire life was an illusion. Another user sat in a semi-reclined chair near a laptop playing music. They experienced being pinned to the chair as if in a rocket ship, with the laptop's light and sound giving instructions and telling them their memories were fake. The user pointed to the laptop, asking for it to be closed, but had no recollection of moving during this time."
722,111099,"The experience began after inhaling a substance from a bong filled by a friend. Initially, the participant felt disconnected from others in the room, noticing visual distortions where people appeared to be still with fast motion photography overlaying their movements. The figures in the room alternated between familiar and unfamiliar faces, including the participant's father and girlfriend.

The participants reported hearing voices saying ""we chose you"" and feeling as though these beings were placing them somewhere intentionally. They then experienced a visual of heads floating and vibrating together under a rainbow filter before spiraling into colors. This was followed by intense paranoia, with the sensation of beings jumping over them like a stampede, causing physical vibrations in their arm.

The participant felt stuck in a loop without understanding time or their surroundings, perceiving D's room as a TV set and everyone present as actors. They had difficulty distinguishing reality from the trip and sought to leave the setting after about 10 minutes, still feeling trippy effects. The experience lasted approximately 45 minutes before fully subsiding.

Upon coming down, the participant felt refreshed senses and an enhanced perception of physical stimuli."
723,63088,"The participant smoked a substance and experienced an intense hallucination characterized by a sense of falling into a two-dimensional plane within their mind. They lost awareness of their physical body and surroundings, feeling as though everything was being zipped together in a linear fashion. The experience included auditory elements such as a sing-songy voice that seemed to change from innocent to ominous.

After about one minute, the participant regained some control over their body but remained uncertain if the reality they were experiencing was real or an extension of the hallucination. They asked others if they were real and attempted to move around while still feeling disconnected from their physical form.

The visual distortions continued after regaining partial awareness, including a whirling sensation and the perception that everything had a warped umbrella-like shape. The participant also experienced color changes in objects they observed, such as a poster's border turning gray and writing changing colors.

Overall, the trip lasted approximately 30 minutes from the initial hit to the end of visual distortions."
724,92734,"The participant consumed an unspecified substance with two friends in a spontaneous evening activity. After inhaling about 1/4 gram in one draw and holding for over a minute, they experienced a sudden disorientation where time seemed to shatter. They moved to sit on a bed against the wall, laughing uncontrollably without any apparent reason.

The participant then reported their head splitting open multiple times, revealing recreations of the room inside their mouth. Each split led them into new layers of reality built by tiny people who experienced joy and death over generations. The descent through these realities sped up rapidly, leading to a paralysis where they could not move or communicate due to the overwhelming emotional experiences.

After what felt like hundreds of years, time locked in place and the participant's head slammed shut, bringing them back into reality. They collapsed onto their friend's lap, still unable to move fully. For the next twenty minutes, brief hallucinations occurred, including distortions of time and gravity. It took about half an hour for the participant to realize there was more to existence beyond the room they were in."
725,105817,"The participant administered a sublingually diluted essence in a quiet bedroom setting. They noted similarities to previous LSD experiences, particularly vibrant colors that appeared pointillist when eyes were open. However, with closed eyes, the visuals had a pronounced depth, suggesting a three-dimensional quality and potential for immersive experiences. The participant attempted to engage with external stimuli such as music and videos but found themselves avoiding deeper introspection. Upon coming down from the experience, they reflected on its impact and their readiness for it. They experienced no interactions with any other entities or substances."
726,88740,"The participant began their experience by smoking small amounts of dried leaves and an extract in a dark room. They felt slight numbness in their jaw and skull base, along with spreading warmth through their head. The effects were mild initially, but after chewing 5 grams of dried leaves for almost 20 minutes and then smoking more extract, the sensations intensified.

Lying down with a cloth over their eyes, the participant experienced elongation and slipping out of their body lengthwise. They perceived an alive presence in the room, feeling as if they had disturbed someone's privacy. The sensation was overwhelming but not unpleasant. There were thoughts about possibly becoming insane due to these experiences, but the participant reassured themselves that it would only last a few minutes.

The participant felt an impulse to get up and move around but feared potential harm if their body acted independently while in this altered state. They covered their eyes again but saw nothing. The strange presence began to recede after a minute or two, and normalcy returned as the cloth was removed from over their eyes.

On a subsequent day, the participant reflected on their fear of fully surrendering to the substance's effects, comparing it to sleep and dreaming. They considered using restraints to feel safer during future experiences."
727,102925,"The participant prepared a tea from dried leaves of an unspecified substance by simmering them gently in water for 15 minutes. After brushing their teeth thoroughly, they sipped the bitter-tasting tea slowly over about an hour. Within two minutes, they began to feel effects and sat on the edge of the bed.

With eyes open, furniture lines appeared to bend back and forth. When lying down with closed eyes, vivid pre-hypnogogic imagery emerged, featuring cartoons, Pixar-like creatures, stick figures, and plant-like forms that morphed continuously in a two-dimensional black-and-white visual field without emotional content or clear meaning.

The participant experienced an open, positive mood characterized by increased laughter and spontaneous gratitude. This effect lasted several days post-experience. The next day, the participant reported a mild lingering headache but felt their mind and perceptions were clear with no noticeable ill effects."
728,108054,"The participant began their experience feeling regretful about holding grudges against family members and others. They felt utterly alone as the only living thing in existence, with everything else being part of an eternal place or non-place. The physical sensations started when they smoked the substance, leading to a pounding heart and walking around. They saw neon colors forming into city silhouettes before experiencing a powerful magnetic force that whipped through their body from left to right.

This sensation intensified until it felt like a ripping apart of themselves into a timeline fading off into an abyss. The participant then separated from this moment and found themselves in the abyss, hearing and feeling a thundering wave of time rolling through moments. They experienced a previous hospital stay after overdosing on mushrooms, with their mother telling them what had happened and their wrists bruised by handcuffs.

The participant felt as if they might be in a coma and continually tried to rise into another reality while hearing people cheering them on. This experience seemed to overlap with the mushroom overdose trip, feeding off each other as similar realities. After this, they were back in the abyss with their slices, meeting the time wave again. The time wave felt brutal and naked, exposing every part of them.

Someone or something pulled them up by the wrists until they were sitting, but it turned out no one had actually helped. Post-trip, the participant was afraid but alive, reflecting on facing all fears and comparing their current consciousness to a goldfish compared to an average human's after such experiences."
729,67518,"The participant began their experience by smoking what they believed to be 5x potency Salvia Divinorum in a homemade bong while taking a shower. Almost immediately after inhaling, they felt disoriented and experienced a blurring of reality that lasted for several seconds. During this time, the individual lost all sense of identity and surroundings.

As the effects intensified, the participant perceived a stream-like flow of visual distortions emanating from a focal point in their vision. They heard two sounds: one resembling flowing water (later identified as the shower) and another rhythmic sound that seemed to repeat a name. The participant's arm appeared at the edge of their distorted field of vision, helping them regain some sense of self.

Gradually, the visual distortions receded, revealing a hazy, rippling view of reality. The individual then became aware of being naked in the bathroom and rushed to put on clothes before leaving to search for their girlfriend. They were confused about the passage of time and why she was not home yet.

Within two minutes after exiting the bathroom, the participant's sense of self returned fully. They conducted mental checks to ensure they were still themselves and had not gone insane or lost their identity permanently. The experience left them with a profound appreciation for being human again and contemplating the nature of existence."
730,81042,"The individual prepared for the experience by showering, shaving, and setting up an incense-lit ritual space. After chewing 10g of dry Salvia leaf, they experienced no immediate effects but then felt a need to improve posture and turn their neck to the left as reality began to ""unpeel."" The participant became aware of an alternate reality filled with intensely colored plant-like structures extending infinitely in all directions.

In this altered state, the individual encountered a procession of beings emerging from a doorway they had opened. The first being was described as a 3-foot caterpillar standing upright and green and yellow in color. It nodded its head to the participant before disappearing into the garden along with other beings.

As the effects began to wear off, the participant noticed a ""wormhole"" appearing in their physical space, expanding and moving forward. They were able to perceive both realities simultaneously and found that focusing on the wormhole caused it to stop expanding. The experience concluded with the wormhole fading away or the perception of it fading."
731,80825,"The narrator describes their first experience alone in a room after intense meditation. Upon inhaling the substance, they see a giant caterpillar-like creature beckoning them to join another realm. This is followed by an interaction with an invisible entity that seems to toy with them, creating a sense of being ""fucked with."" The narrator also sees themselves from above, laughing at the wall.

In subsequent experiences, the narrator invites friends and notes varying reactions; only three out of ten had positive experiences while others were terrified or confused. The narrator emphasizes the importance of approaching the experience without expectations to achieve profound insights.

During a recent gathering, the narrator prepares to inhale the substance with friends present. After inhalation, they feel their mind being pulled back through a wormhole, and the room folds into kaleidoscopic colors and shapes. They encounter elf-like creatures mining consciousnesses in a field while singing circus music. The elves telepathically instruct the narrator to ""harvest"" their friends, leading to confusion and laughter.

The narrator pulls themselves out of this state, back to reality, feeling physically altered with burning skin and sweating profusely. They attempt to explain the experience to their friends but find it difficult to convey the surreal events they witnessed."
732,78022,"The participant had their first experience with Salvia divinorum using the quid method. They chewed 5 grams of dried leaves for two sessions of 30 minutes each, spitting out the quids after each session. Subtle effects began around 20 minutes into the first session, including a feeling of heaviness and slight ataxia.

During the second session, the participant experienced increased happiness and laughter, as well as a sense of being a different person. With closed eyes, they perceived a two-dimensional black hole with swirling particles, which was associated with a sensation that time had stopped. They also reported flying over green pillars standing in rows, which fell over as they passed.

After about an hour, the effects began to subside. The participant experienced a profound sense of indifference and transcendence during this comedown phase, feeling that their worries were irrelevant and that they could overcome any challenges. This state persisted for approximately one hour after the peak experience.

The next morning, the participant noted an ""afterglow"" effect with enhanced imagination and a changed perception of familiar places. The feelings of transcendence continued for over a week post-experience."
733,84088,"The participant began their spiritual journey by preparing through meditation and connecting with the spirit of the substance, referred to as ""the dragon leaf."" They were instructed on how to ingest it properly and spent time letting their energy mingle with the plant. The experience took place in a city park-like setting after breakfast.

Upon smoking the first dose, they felt a clearing of negative energies but did not feel giddy or see things initially. After consuming all the leaf, they entered a building where their mind felt clearer and sharper. God manifested briefly to confirm certain truths known to the participant.

The individual then went shopping and had dinner, experiencing only slight light-headedness throughout. They noted a feeling of health and well-being. During this time, any visions or meetings with entities were limited due to various reasons.

After returning home about twelve hours later, they felt reasonably awake and ready for rest. The experience was described as going very well, confirming spiritual understandings and providing insights into the nature of the universe, including revelations about dimensions, energy, and consciousness."
734,70770,"The participant smoked a high-potency substance for the third time, holding it in longer than before. After smoking, they felt their feet dragging as if through quicksand while walking downstairs. Their roommate appeared cartoonish and animated. The participant returned upstairs, feeling disoriented and unable to communicate. They laid down on their bed, experiencing a warm flush and sinking limbs. In their mind, they designed buildings in a Romanesque style. Music from the laptop was deconstructed inside their head during one point of the experience.

The participant's best friend entered the room after about 40 minutes, turning on the lights and asking how it was going. The participant mumbled that they were tripping heavily and asked for the lights to be turned off again. They continued lying down with pillows over their face and under blankets, opening their eyes occasionally but finding it difficult to keep objects at eye level.

After another 15 minutes, the participant felt control returning slowly. They got up and walked downstairs, still mildly tripping for about an hour more. The experience lasted approximately one hour in total. The next day, they reported sleeping poorly and feeling slightly affected until noon."
735,70192,"The participant begins their experience while sitting at their computer after repeated dosing of an unnamed substance. They feel a shift in reality, with everything around them seeming to be part of a painting or visual field rather than tangible objects. The participant experiences spinning sensations and a pulling feeling described as ""gravity,"" which is associated with the mind being pulled backward and outward.

Entities referred to as ""smelves"" appear during the experience. These entities are described as anthropomorphic, eerily communicative energies that live in the cracks between dimensions. They are characterized by bright primary colors, a playful yet sarcastic demeanor, and an ability to communicate complex ideas through their presence. The participant interacts with these smelves, addressing them as if they were separate beings.

The experience includes moments of existential questioning, where the participant confronts the nature of reality and identity. There is a sense that what was previously considered ""alive"" or part of the self becomes inanimate, while inanimate objects take on a life-like quality. The participant describes feeling as though their mind has been turned inside out, with awareness existing outside the body's normal confines.

The experience lasts for several minutes before fading, and the participant attempts to document it immediately afterward."
736,89483,"The individual had two experiences with a substance that caused intense visual and psychological effects. During the first experience, they felt confused and saw intricate patterns through a window but did not fully enter into a hallucinatory state due to the method of consumption. The second trip was more profound, starting with physical sensations like tingling in the back and difficulty speaking. They perceived an endless stream of reality repeating itself, which they interpreted as a glimpse of the time continuum. This led to existential questioning about the nature of reality and consciousness.

The user felt disconnected from their body and experienced intense paranoia, believing that higher aspects of their mind were manipulating their perceptions. They saw familiar objects transform into abstract forms and questioned whether what they perceived was real or hallucinatory. The experience ended with a return to normal perception but left them in an altered state characterized by confusion and difficulty processing thoughts.

After the trip, the user felt compelled to reflect on the experience deeply and had dreams that night. They expressed a desire to explore further into these altered states of consciousness through other means."
737,96415,"The participant took what they believed to be a low dose of a substance in a clearing in the woods. Shortly after, they experienced physical effects such as feeling crippled and only having half their body present. They also felt an immense pressure pulling them down. The world around them seemed to transform into a symbolic realm where everything was different from reality. Objects and events took on deeper meanings related to the participant's life.

The participant's dog appeared more human-like, and they perceived real presences in this altered state. They felt as if their old life had brought them here and viewed it as a form of punishment for being careless with the substance. The experience included intense physical sensations like melting and the world appearing cut in half or reduced to only the bottom half.

After about five minutes, the participant managed to regain some clarity and recognized that they were experiencing the effects of the substance. They felt profound effects for an extended period, including a desire to escape and shut off from reality. The experience lasted approximately one hour before the participant gradually returned to baseline."
738,66462,"The participant began their experience by smoking a small amount of a substance earlier in the day, resulting in mild visuals and a strong body high while remaining aware throughout. Later that evening, they smoked more of the same substance, leading to an intense experience where everything went black before transitioning into a new plane of reality. From this vantage point, they perceived their entire existence and the world's existence as an endlessly rotating mass, feeling both part of it and outside of it simultaneously.

As the intensity increased, the participant felt physical discomfort from staying still and began rolling around the room while friends watched in amusement. The experience then shifted to a mix of reality and this altered state, with the body breaking apart into fractals before reassembling. After about five minutes of wobbling, they lay down to sleep.

The participant had no memory of what happened after putting down the smoking device for the last time but was told by friends that they collapsed onto a bean bag chair, then onto the floor shaking while counting aloud in an unclear pattern. The overall experience was described as intensely joyful and scary, unlike anything experienced before."
739,76911,"In a dining room setting, the participant experienced confusion and dizziness after smoking an unknown substance. They walked into the living room where they perceived the TV screen as containing a figure of the host from Top Gear hanging onto its side and yelling at them to turn it off. The participant believed this was due to their actions causing distress to the host. They attempted to find the power button on the entertainment center, which appeared sideways to them. When unable to locate it, they turned to their sitter for help in turning off the TV. After successfully turning off the TV, the participant realized they had smoked the substance and experienced lingering dizziness and a headache."
740,78998,"The participant smoked salvia in their dorm room with their boyfriend. After inhaling deeply, they noticed three girls walking outside but then perceived them as Disney princesses on a birthday card when looking away from the window. The boyfriend's head appeared segmented into small square diagrams of his face descending like a ladder, which was frightening to the participant. They closed their eyes and laid down, muttering that everything needed to stop. When they looked up again, they could only see portions of their boyfriend's head at a time.

The participant then saw a cupcake and hoarded it behind their head, becoming defensive when their boyfriend tried to take it from them. They ate the cupcake quickly. The account mentions little recollection of what happened next but notes that they smoked marijuana with their friend who also experienced salvia effects. After two hours, the group went out with sober friends and ate pizza."
741,63967,"The individual and their friends consumed an unnamed substance at a friend's house. The first hit caused immediate laughter and disorientation. The user felt as if they were on a train and in a pop-up book simultaneously, experiencing duality between reality and unreality. They had internal conversations and debates while others continued to smoke the substance.

Afterwards, the group prepared for another round. As the second dose took effect, the individual felt drunk and experienced computer-generated visuals. They wandered into a willow tree area where they felt an urge to relieve themselves. While doing so, they noticed a dark figure across the fence, which they believed was a dryad. The figure stood silently, seemingly curious about the user's presence.

The user approached the figure and greeted it but received no response. After asking if it lived there, the user became uncomfortable and walked away, feeling watched by the entity. They returned to the deck, trying to process what had happened, knowing they could not fully explain it."
742,64379,"The narrator and their girlfriend used an unspecified substance at a wooded location near Saint Martins University. After inhaling the substance, both experienced immediate physical effects including tingling sensations and uncontrollable laughter. The girlfriend became disoriented but remained in a positive state.

The narrator attempted to write a symbol on a nearby tree but found it difficult to move due to the effects of the substance. They then perceived their surroundings as alive with personalities and hierarchies, communicating telepathically. A specific uprooted tree appeared to try convincing them to merge with it, which caused some fear in the narrator.

The girlfriend was initially confused about the narrator's question regarding becoming a tree but eventually declined the idea. The narrator also decided against merging with the forest after briefly experiencing what it felt like to be part of it. They then returned to their girlfriend and drew a symbol on a post-it note, which they believed represented healing.

Afterwards, both individuals walked back to the narrator's house where they lay in bed until feeling more normal."
743,64423,"The individual began their experience alone on a back deck in the evening with pleasant weather conditions. They used a torch to heat leaves placed in a pipe, inhaling deeply three times. After the second hit, they felt respiratory discomfort but continued. The scenery around them, initially colorful and warm, imploded into darkness.

At this point, the individual reported feeling as though their body had dissolved, merging with an adirondak chair. They perceived a cosmic event of creation before experiencing deep paranoia. A feminine entity began chasing them through various settings, each time mocking their weakness for hiding herbs. The trip was described as having directionality and increasing in intensity.

The experience included sleepwalking, during which the individual moved from the deck to the basement without conscious awareness. Upon waking in the basement, they felt disoriented but managed to return to the deck. They ended the session by burning the remaining herb on a concrete slab out of reverence and residual paranoia."
744,64750,"The participant began by using an unknown substance multiple times over several days, experiencing mild effects such as gravitational distortions and undulating sensations. On a later occasion, while under the influence of another pill and feeling bored, they consumed their remaining supply of the unknown substance. This led to intense visual alterations where everything appeared in pale greyish tones with hints of color, similar to black-and-white imagery with slight hues.

The participant then heard child-like voices inviting them to play, which prompted them to close their eyes. Upon opening them again, they found themselves in a surreal environment resembling a giant domed playroom with animated landscapes and floating particles. A red entity with a snake-like body and giraffe-like markings communicated that it was time to return home from playing an elaborate game called 'reality'. This entity described reality as an illusion created by the participant's mind.

A smaller, yellow entity also present seemed eager to leave this environment. The participant experienced a sense of disappointment upon realizing their life might be a fantasy in another dimension's child's mind. They saw a miniature cross-section of Earth's crust and core with flashes of historical events and personal memories. The red entity urged them to return before it was too late, but the participant chose to stay for a moment longer.

After what seemed like a brief period, the participant returned to their room, feeling relief at being back in familiar surroundings. They experienced sweating and a smile upon realizing the previous experience had been an intense trip. The participant felt a slight guilt about choosing this reality over the other one they encountered during the trip."
745,63687,"The participant began their experience feeling alone in the dark, listening to music. They felt a sense of unity with everything around them and experienced a stuck sensation. From this state, they perceived themselves from an ascended viewpoint, looking down at their seated form as if in a snow globe. This led to a backward journey through past moments of psychosis.

During these moments, the participant experienced intense emotions such as rage, fear, and insecurity. They also interacted with objects like a bong, which flickered between different versions from their lifetime. The mind became an enemy, causing confusion and panic.

As the intensity faded, the participant moved around the room, attempting to find help to leave the experience. They perceived the bed as a pulsing vortex and eventually lay face down on what appeared to be a prismatic rainbow path. Unable to move, they relinquished control and experienced being water in a water wheel before the trip began to wane.

The participant reflected on their journey, understanding that they were always present everywhere and every time. They acknowledged the need for evolution to take their body with them and emphasized spreading knowledge about consciousness."
746,65227,"The participant smoked salvia in a friend's room after consuming marijuana earlier. Upon inhaling the smoke deeply, they felt as if they were sliding into an abyss and experienced their body melting into a rubber-like state with a rough texture. They saw numbers and pieces of clothing come to life around them, communicating in non-verbal ways. The room transformed into what seemed like a TV station, and objects began unzipping and becoming alive. The participant felt disconnected from reality and experienced an out-of-body experience where they could see themselves walking away from their physical body. As the trip ended, they reported feeling incredibly high for about 45 minutes."
747,69598,"The participant began by reading about a substance in a store and decided to try it at home alone. They took an extract, which led them into a dream-like state where they felt like a child and were confused about their surroundings. A female voice spoke to them, and they perceived a stuffed animal bunny face, though no such item was present in the room.

The participant then found themselves outside, feeling pressure all around their body as if being wrapped in a rug. They attempted to open pocket doors but felt like they had to climb over them instead of walking through. The roommate emerged from his nap and called 911 when the participant yelled for help, not realizing it was a substance-induced state.

After regaining some awareness, the participant explained what happened and found that papers and books were scattered around the room, with damage to the printer and desk. They had no recollection of causing this destruction. The experience left them feeling jittery and anxious, with physical symptoms like heat and nausea. However, by morning, they felt fine without any lingering negative effects."
748,71703,"The participant experienced two sessions with an unnamed substance. In the first session, they used 5x and then 10x concentrations in a glass pipe. After inhaling the 10x concentration, they perceived themselves merging with train tracks and heard rain. They felt embarrassed by this experience while being watched by their friend.

In the second session, about a week later, the participant used a 20x concentration alone with their brother as a sitter. They inhaled the substance deeply and experienced becoming a large white sphere made up of puzzle pieces. There was a red hole on the sphere that they felt someone was watching, causing them to try covering it up. The experience included seeing themselves, their brother, and the room while under the influence. They mentioned feeling watched and having difficulty maintaining the altered state due to awareness of reality.

The participant concluded that being observed during these experiences made it difficult to fully immerse in the hallucinations, leading to a desire to try the substance alone in future sessions for a more profound experience."
749,61918,"The participant initiated a session by taking an initial hit of the substance, followed by two more hits as they felt it necessary for a fuller experience. They experienced mild effects initially and then progressed into visual hallucinations. The left side of the room appeared normal while the right side was described as strange and eerie.

During one phase of the trip, the participant saw themselves floating above a stone wall with bluish-gray scenery beyond. They perceived this area to be dangerous and avoided it. Another scene involved standing on a yellow pier overlooking an ocean of pure blue water. The participant felt a presence next to them but could not see it clearly.

The music played during the experience intensified their hallucinations, particularly Pink Floyd's ""Hey You"" and Muse's ""Starlight."" When closing their eyes, they saw patterns of dark and light blues on the backside of their face while the rest was red. The participant communicated with others in the room but found it difficult to articulate what they were experiencing.

The entire experience lasted approximately 30-45 minutes before coming to an end."
750,62456,"The participant experienced intense visual distortions shortly after consuming the substance. They reported that lines appeared across a poster on the wall, which stretched beyond its edges and transformed into various images such as rubber ducks and humans standing on each other's heads. The participant felt a loss of ego and entered a state where they perceived themselves as part of a chaotic realm with neon colors.

During this experience, the participant was simultaneously aware of sounds from another room, perceiving them as powerful and divine but also potentially deceitful. They were at a crossroads between two dimensions: one leading to a vortex-like structure and the other through a doorway into an unknown presence. The participant felt drawn towards five candle flames in the corner of the room, which they perceived as pure entities or spirits.

The experience shifted abruptly when the name ""Salvia"" came to mind, and the participant returned to their body with complete awareness of their surroundings. They then experienced a milder high for about 5-10 minutes before gradually returning to normalcy within half an hour. The presence of others in the room during this time caused some distraction and discomfort.

The participant's friend who tried the substance next had a more intense and distressing experience, which was attributed to the noise and interruptions from the other participants."
751,64147,"The participant and two friends inhaled an unknown substance from a pipe. Initially, the participant felt a normal high but then experienced visual distortions where everything seemed to concentrate into the center of their field of vision. They reported feeling pushed forward gently yet forcefully. The friend sitting next to them had similar sensations.

After inhaling more of the substance, the participant's vision condensed again and was enveloped by an intense golden light. This led to a void-like state followed by vivid colors that triggered memories. Each color brought a set of emotions and experiences, layering on top of each other until reality seemed solidified once more.

Upon returning to reality, the participant found themselves standing behind their car with no memory of how they got there. They were muttering incoherently but could speak simple phrases like ""whoa"" or ""wait."" Physical discomfort included sweating and feeling both hot and cold simultaneously. The lingering sensation was one of peace and fulfillment."
752,61916,"The participant prepared for their first full trip by barricading themselves in a room to ensure safety. They smoked a large amount of smoke from a pipe, holding it in for about 30 seconds before exhaling and taking another hit. The experience began around 20 seconds after inhalation.

During the peak of the experience, the participant felt as if they were traveling faster than the speed of light on a train to another world. They perceived dark surroundings and heard voices of young girls, described as midget elves, chanting in a high-pitched mocking tone. The chant was partially understood but lost before completion. 

The participant then entered what they described as a Salvador Dali painting, where everything appeared vibrant, glowing, and melting slowly. A strong female presence was felt, perceived as a goddess watching over them. They turned their eyes to the left and saw an image directly overtop of the chair/door they were looking at before, creating a dual perception.

The participant then experienced a sensation of being in a giant field with bright green grass while holding onto the pipe's stem, feeling like it was attached to their face. Their right cheek felt as if it was stretching out to eternity. 

As the experience began to fade, the participant became aware that they were still holding the pipe and had smoked salvia. The message from the midget elf girls was twisted in their mind into ""don't forget to call your friends."" They stood up quickly to find their phone but felt it was a dangerous idea.

The come down felt similar to the onset of a mushroom trip, with energy and a desire to talk to someone. The participant experienced vivid dreams that night and had a mild headache for most of the next day, though they remained calm and at peace."
753,61964,"The individual participated in two sessions of an unknown substance with their friend D and his girlfriend P. During the first session, they took one strong hit and another weaker one. This resulted in visual distortions where flat surfaces appeared to break into brightly colored hexagonal tiles about the size of a thumbnail. The participant felt as if there was ""jello"" all over them which they wiped off, saying it represented ""failure."" They experienced general giddiness but did not laugh much during their trip.

In the second session, two large hits were taken, leading to an extremely intense experience. Visuals included brightly colored tiles covering everything, reminiscent of Aztec/Inca/Toltec art. The participant felt as if they had lost all awareness and ego, becoming part of a swirling pattern that included memories of family members from childhood. They perceived a TV character looking at them with disgust and pity before being pulled back to reality by P taking their hand.

The experience was described as alien and bizarre, leaving the individual unsure what to learn from it but feeling there is something valuable behind the ""membrane"" they passed through during the trip."
754,62526,"The participant consumed an unknown dose of a substance and experienced intense visual and auditory distortions. They felt extremely stoned, with a pulsating sensation throughout their body and surroundings. A motherly voice inside their head gave nonsensical instructions, such as how to assemble parts for a boat on an assembly line.

The participant's perception of reality became fragmented; they could only see the legs of one friend while the other appeared in a cartoonish, anime-like form. The dashboard of the car seemed to have grown additional panels, creating a surreal scene with three seats instead of two.

Suddenly, applause drowned out the motherly voice, replaced by Bob Barker's voice announcing a game show inside their head. They felt as if they were on ""The Price is Right"" and jumped around in excitement, hoping to be chosen as contestants.

Next, the participant saw a large purple puffball smoking a cigarette, which resembled something from ""Scarface."" This entity laughed deeply and instructed them to kill ten men and return with their scalps. Terrified by this command, they ran away but later returned to the car, where everything began to normalize slightly as the effects wore off.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling stoned but less intense than before, eventually coming down from the trip."
755,64429,"The participant began using a substance (likely salvia) in social settings but found that group use limited their experiences to mild hallucinations. They then experimented with solo sessions in controlled environments, eventually achieving deeper states of consciousness. During one session, they combined the substance with marijuana, aiming to enhance dream recall and prolong the effects.

The experience began with typical visual distortions and physical sensations associated with the substance. As the participant lay in bed, they experienced a transition into a state where sensory inputs were muffled but could still be perceived faintly. They then entered a constructed world of their imagination, where reality was represented by various elements such as an ego bordering on nonexistence.

An entity, described as female and associated with the substance, appeared to guide the participant through this experience, indicating that it was time to move along from the edge of existence. The participant reported feeling conscious in a state between existence and nothingness for some time before returning to reality.

Upon waking after about three hours, the participant found themselves talking to an unseen person, expressing frustration at being close to further exploration but unable to continue. They then fell asleep again, experiencing what they described as their greatest dreams yet."
756,62267,"The individual began their experience by inhaling smoke and laying down near flowers beside a brook. They perceived the sky as if it were directly in front of them, with trees forming a tunnel leading towards it. This led to a sensation of floating and being in a foreign world from which they could not return.

Closing and opening their eyes made no difference; instead, the universe appeared as two diagonal lines folding and morphing around each other, with the participant feeling connected to one line. As reality began to re-emerge, vague faces were seen on blades of grass leading towards flowers. The individual followed this path until they picked up a dead branch from a rose bush, initially unable to comprehend its identity but later recognizing it.

The experience then shifted as the participant approached yellow flowers that appeared to be smiling at them. Upon touching one flower, there was an intense sensation of the flower screaming in agony during its removal from the stem. The individual felt remorseful and promised to take care of the flower.

As the effects began to wane, the person stood up unsteadily and walked back through the woods towards their house, feeling a deep connection with nature and at peace. They stopped by a brook before returning home, where they placed the flower in water as promised."
757,62219,"The participant and their friends gathered at a friend's house to smoke an unknown substance. They laid out a mattress covered with a blanket on the floor of the bedroom. The participant smoked heavily from a glass bowl, experiencing intense sensations that made them laugh uncontrollably. As the trip progressed, they noticed that inanimate objects appeared angular while people and the rabbit were brightly colored and curved.

The participant tried to explain their observations to their friends but found it difficult to convey their thoughts clearly. They pointed out the mattress as an example of a box-like structure and mentioned that the rabbit was bunny-shaped, which amused them greatly. The experience included feelings of warmth and a sense of humor about the situation."
758,54220,"The individual prepared for their first experience by sitting in a darkened living room and listening to relaxing music while smoking an unnamed substance from a pipe. After several hits, they felt as if reality was being ripped away and found themselves standing on a large hill covered with hay or wheat. A fish-like entity appeared at the bottom of the hill and transformed into a muscular demon figure wielding a blade, which then morphed again into an absurd shape with a sunken chest, swollen belly, thin limbs, and huge flat hands.

The demon pointed upwards, encouraging the participant to look skyward, where they began rocketing through space as a soft blue ball of light. They followed a tendril of blue-gray smoke at what felt like the speed of light until hearing voices, one of which said, ""You're not supposed to be here yet."" This statement brought them back to reality.

The participant then smoked more of the substance and experienced a rapid departure from their physical body, feeling as if they were separating from it. They briefly touched their earthly body with what felt like their soul and found it intact. The rest of the experience consisted of brief glimpses of amazing visions that could not be fully described in words.

The next day, the individual reported feeling spectacular, smiling and laughing more than usual."
759,58821,"In this experience, the individual sat in a quiet room after consuming a substance. They heard a voice from a nearby TV describing their actions and stating that they had been removed from their world as punishment for using an unnamed technology. The voice was perceived as belonging to an alien being. 

The participant became aware of a rotating wheel with different realities at each stop. One reality depicted a street lined with identical grey-green overalls-clad houses and people, resembling but not exactly like the familiar world.

The individual attempted to negotiate their return by pleading humbly. The aliens agreed on the condition that the participant acknowledged all worlds as equally real. As a result, the usual environment was reconstructed around them by the aliens taking the form of objects such as a fridge, bike, and chair.

During the experience, no visual impression of the alien entities was formed, even while observing their transformation into familiar surroundings. The encounter concluded with the participant feeling elated despite the intensity of the experience."
760,58600,"The individual began their experience feeling a blurring sensation before descending into a state where they felt like melted rubber. They perceived everything around them as connected rubber with various colors and shapes. A number 10 appeared to be alive, with eyes, and was connected to a pair of pants that unzipped into a monster-like form. The user communicated telepathically with this entity but did not understand the language.

As the experience progressed, the individual felt pressure from the rubbery environment and attempted to move away. They jumped onto a bed, experiencing an explosion of softness that enveloped their body. The TV in the room also came alive and communicated with the user, though its message was unclear. The user perceived everything as meaningless and saw an abyss through holes created by unzipping objects.

The individual then experienced a split consciousness, seeing themselves leave their body and walk out of the room into a glitchy reality characterized by repeating patterns of clouds and sky. They heard their friends' voices from afar before returning to the original space with open-eye visuals ceasing but closed-eye visions persisting. For about 45 minutes after the experience, they felt high and everything seemed more meaningful."
761,58181,"The participant began their experience by smoking a substance they believed would produce effects similar to those of mushrooms. After inhaling, they quickly felt the onset and experienced a vivid hallucination where reality was replaced by scenes from Alice in Wonderland. In this altered state, they encountered several entities: first, a talking door that opened into a dark room with a lightning bolt streaking across it, out of which emerged an ""electric ghost"" that zipped them around at high speed. Next, a fat yellow cartoon character wearing a Globetrotters uniform appeared and began dribbling their head like a basketball while running alongside the lightning bolt. The background flashed like a strobe light.

After exiting the lightning bolt, they were thrown into a vertical puddle of water, which brought them back to reality momentarily. They found themselves in their friend's room, both laughing uncontrollably but unable to speak due to drooling. A new entity appeared: an animated version of Burger King with blonde hair and a jewel-encrusted scepter, known as ""the word king."" This character reached into the participant's mouth and pulled out specific words (""the,"" ""sleep,"" ""to,"" and ""walk""), which they could see were black and as tall as their mouth. The word king then waved his scepter at them before they fell back into a dreamlike state.

Upon waking up, the participant found themselves in the kitchen with their girlfriend, unable to say the words that had been taken by the word king. They felt cold and drenched in sweat. After changing clothes and passing out on a bunk bed, they woke up again and recounted their experience to their girlfriend. She described how the participant had run around the house, jumping through invisible hoops and yelling random sounds before collapsing.

The entire trip lasted about 9 minutes, followed by a four-hour sleep period during which the participant regained their ability to speak normally."
762,57832,"The individual prepared to try a hallucinogenic substance for the first time along with friends in their home while parents were away. A friend demonstrated by smoking a small amount of the substance and experienced intense effects that lasted about 15 minutes, including visual distortions and a sense of calm after closing his eyes.

Next, the participant smoked a larger dose and immediately felt disoriented as his vision concaved inward. He lost memory of the next few minutes but then found himself in an apartment building where he was constructing something with two other people. The environment appeared cartoonish or made of plasticine material. Suddenly, he became anxious and saw two large Lego-like beings sneering at him.

The participant perceived these beings as trying to fit him into a wall of Lego blocks that spelled out a word, which would kill him if completed. He fought them intensely to avoid this fate. Afterward, he experienced falling into a lake with docks and then floating in the universe where an immense being presented him with several doors or playing cards representing different parts of his experience, including reality.

The participant felt intense pressure to choose the correct door, fearing eternal entrapment if wrong. He lost consciousness until waking up in a chair in his living room. The entire trip lasted longer than expected and was described as highly distressing. Afterward, he learned that during his struggle with the Lego beings, he had been physically restrained by friends who were trying to keep him seated."
763,58501,"The individual began their experience in a van parked between two corn fields on a cold, windy day. After inhaling the substance, they felt lightheaded and fell back into what seemed like oblivion. Upon regaining consciousness, they flailed and yelled about wanting to listen to a specific song but struggled to communicate clearly. They perceived an overpowering force pushing them back towards their seat and eventually listened to the desired music while lying down.

During this time, the individual's cell phone rang, and they spoke with their girlfriend, who was unaware of the ongoing experience. The participant became frustrated by the inability to convey their state of mind to others present. They noticed that the corn outside appeared to be blowing in the same direction as an imagined force pulling them back.

The trip intensified, and the individual heard a sound similar to an ultrasound. They decided to leave the van, feeling closer to normal after stepping outside. After waiting a minute, they felt capable of driving again. The experience ended with the participant arriving home and attempting to process what had happened."
764,58318,"The individual began their experience by inhaling a significant amount of a substance, likely salvia divinorum. After about 45 seconds, they noticed the room seemed to twitch like a clock going tick-tock up and down. At one minute in, they felt an intense warmth despite feeling cold, leading to uncontrollable laughter. They experienced difficulty closing their mouth as if it were wide open.

At two minutes, the room appeared to be shaking violently while they remained still, creating a sensation similar to being buried in a hole with the floor rising around them like a blanket. The individual reported deep thoughts and vivid imagery of colors and G-forces within an office-like setting.

By five minutes, the world felt as if it were rolling over itself, and the floor seemed to be made of jello but hardened just before touch. A wave of relaxation hit at ten minutes, followed by a complete body high at fifteen minutes, described as landing back in reality after a rapid journey through time."
765,57144,"The individual was at a friend's house watching a movie when they decided to consume a small amount of an entheogen extract. They smoked it using a water bong and felt increasingly disconnected from their surroundings after each hit. The first two hits made them feel light-headed, with the second causing a strong force-like sensation holding them down.

After taking a third hit, the participant reported entering a different state of being where they experienced full ego loss. They felt as though they were in an endless hole and became scared, believing they might be stuck there permanently. However, upon accepting this possibility, they began to return to reality. The transition back was gradual; initially feeling strange and upset before fully returning to baseline.

The entire experience lasted approximately 15-20 minutes, but the participant felt it had been much longer."
766,57512,"The experience began in a room where the participant smoked an unknown substance, leading to immediate visual distortions and a sense of being 'baked'. They found themselves in a brightly colored forest with detailed plant-like people and animals that were not real. The participant was unable to speak during this time but communicated with the plant-like entities.

As the experience progressed, the participant realized nothing was real, including their own existence and the concept of a universe. This led to panic as they perceived the end of the world approaching. They saw their sister transform into squares that fell apart, and felt themselves becoming part of the floor, unable to move or escape.

The experience then shifted back to reality, where the participant was lying on a bed in what appeared grey and drab compared to the colorful forest. They were sweating heavily, gasping for breath, and could not understand their sister and friend's conversation. The physical body during this time reportedly twitched and drooled uncontrollably."
767,57966,"The participant was alone in their room when they ingested the substance. Initially, there were no effects after inhaling the smoke. However, as they exhaled and opened the window, they began to feel something strange and eventually fell onto their bed with their eyes shut. They entered a black void that felt like true reality, where all worries were eradicated. This state was accompanied by surreal visuals.

The participant experienced falling backwards, bouncing on the floor while leaving white line trails forming squares. Inside these squares were frames from the real world scrolling left to right. At the top of the rectangles formed by the trail, there was a platform with a woman figure made entirely of white color and an outline. The woman appeared to welcome the participant into this new reality.

Additionally, the participant saw a completely white silhouette tree against the black void for a few seconds before it disappeared. After these intense visuals, the experience continued with less intensity but still included strange images in colors that were not vibrant. The trip lasted approximately half an hour, followed by a relaxed state for another half an hour."
768,56229,"The individual began by consuming an unknown substance through a bong, taking two hits. After the second hit, they noticed a stoned feeling that progressed into the onset of hallucinations. They observed Jay Leno's image from their TV screen expanding and superimposing across the room. The participant felt as though they were inside a refrigerator with Leno closing the door on them, causing panic. They turned off the TV but continued to hear Leno's voice, unsure if it was still on or not.

The individual then turned off the lights and listened to music, which triggered another phase of hallucinations. They saw meadows and a peculiar vision where they perceived themselves from two angles simultaneously: one from above and another skewed perspective. A beam of light emerged from their chest and transformed into a golden cobblestone bridge emitting beams of light throughout the room.

Two child-like human figures appeared on the bridge, giggling and laughing. They invited the participant to join them, but initially, the participant felt reluctant due to an attachment to something within themselves. After some urging from the forms, another boyish figure emerged from the participant's chest as a dark outline. This figure briefly conversed with the other two before they joined hands and skipped up the bridge into the ceiling."
769,66146,"The individual began their experience by smoking a homemade bong filled with an extract of unknown quantity but estimated around 1/10th of a gram. They immediately felt a strong headrush sensation and experienced some visual distortions, such as furniture and lights appearing altered. The primary effect was a significant body trip characterized by loss of coordination and difficulty moving.

While lying on the bed, they listened to new age music which intensified their mental state, leading to delusions involving faeries, hobbits, and other fantastical beings. They felt detached from their body, as if someone else's hands were rubbing them.

Feeling confident after the initial experience, they smoked another bowl in a closet to avoid detection. During this session, they perceived voices outside the door saying ""Do you smell that,"" which heightened their paranoia. In response, they opened windows and fanned the air, imagining themselves as a small man working bellows in a castle forge.

The individual then engaged in frantic cleaning and preparation for potential visitors, including heating up some food and setting up an alibi at their desk. They experienced intense pressure and heat sensations while looking out the window, seeing a distant person as a spying drone and flapping their arms in response.

As they came down from the experience, they fell asleep drenched in sweat despite the cool room temperature. Upon waking, they felt disoriented with cotton-like head sensations and throbbing pain where their skull had felt pressure earlier. They also experienced lingering effects of elevated body temperature and vivid dreams related to the music played during the trip."
770,56212,"The individual began their experience by taking an initial hit from a bong filled with a potent substance. After about 30 seconds, they noticed tingling sensations in their arms. Upon looking at themselves, they perceived a princess and a horse on either side of them, though these entities were not physically present.

The participant's rational mind became involved in a debate between the horse and the princess regarding whether to take another hit. The horse urged for it while the princess seemed hesitant. Despite initial doubts about the remaining substance, the individual decided to take a second hit after inhaling deeply and thinking ""king,"" which prompted them to exhale.

Following this, they experienced difficulty unscrewing the bong bowl but eventually succeeded with encouragement from the horse. After emptying the bong of water and ice, the participant engaged in playful interaction with the remaining ice blocks, imagining them as rebellious entities that needed punishment. They shook the bong vigorously and then pushed out the ice, stomping on it afterward.

The experience concluded when the individual opened the cellar door and stepped inside, feeling a significant return to normalcy despite an ongoing ""afterglow."" The entire mental process from the first hit to opening the cellar door lasted approximately 10 minutes but felt much longer due to altered perception of time."
771,55838,"The participant began their journey by chewing a quid made from fresh Salvia leaves in their backyard after dark. They experienced increased salivation and found the taste bitter but manageable. After about fifteen minutes, they felt the effects setting in and closed their eyes. Initially, they saw an image of their body being washed with a cool, bluish-white wind, making them feel transparent.

This vision was followed by a recurring sensation: feeling pulled down into another plane through dark vines emerging from a crack in the earth. This place felt eerie and dark, reminiscent of a fairy tale forest. The participant did not want to stay there and opened their eyes, walking unsteadily towards their tomato plants. They tried to rid themselves of the bitter taste by eating a cherry tomato but remained physically uncomfortable.

The tactile sensations were heightened as they sat on dry grass in the garden, feeling its sharpness against their bare legs. They attempted to focus positively on gardening imagery but felt a struggle with dark energy. The journey was cut short when their wife returned home and turned on the kitchen light. An argument ensued after the participant mentioned eating one of their plants.

Feeling rushed and manipulated by their attempt to control the experience, they came back to reality disappointed in themselves and unsure about future Salvia use."
772,55914,"The participant began by inhaling a substance through a water bong, leading to an immediate shift in perception characterized as a 'gravity pivot' along their front teeth and down the middle of their head. This sensation was followed by ripples moving from their toes up to their head, causing the kitchen around them to flicker and change orientation.

The participant experienced a series of vivid scenes from different moments in time, including glimpses of their grandparents' old house in Ohio and a memory from when they were five years old living in Georgia. These scenes were so realistic that sensory details such as smells and sounds were present. The experience also included the sensation of traveling through these 'moments in time,' with each scene lasting for varying durations depending on how the participant tilted their head.

During one particularly vivid scene, the participant felt a strong urge to change something from the past, believing it might alter their future. This led to emotional distress and panic. To regain control, they focused on returning to their normal environment by visualizing a hallway of mirrors that eventually brought them back to their kitchen. The experience was overwhelming, causing the participant to cry during a phone call with a friend.

The overall effect lasted for an extended period, leaving the participant emotionally affected even after the initial high had subsided."
773,71904,"The individual began their experience by taking a moderate hit from a bong containing a high concentration extract. Within seconds, they felt an intense onset and experienced ""the clicking feeling"" as described by others. Initially, there was a brief moment of fear which subsided as the framing effect took over. The participant then reported forgetting their surroundings and experiencing a sense of ego dissolution.

During this phase, reality seemed to rip apart, and the individual perceived themselves as a large zipper made up of the fabric of reality. They described unzipping rapidly while being aware of everything that was and wasn't beneath the zipper. This intense experience caused significant distress until an external voice brought them back to awareness.

After regaining some sense of self, the participant began to communicate about their experience but found it difficult due to rapid speech and incoherence. They noticed a distortion in time perception, believing they had been sitting for hours when only minutes had passed. The intensity gradually decreased, allowing for more coherent thought and interaction with their friend.

The pair then went outside where they discussed the philosophical implications of the substance and its proper use. The participant expressed gratitude for the experience as it reaffirmed aspects of themselves that they hadn't seen in a while and highlighted the potential for continued personal growth through such experiences."
774,65400,"The participant describes two experiences with an unnamed substance. During the first experience, after consuming several cups of mushroom tea and alcohol, they smoked a single hit of the substance in a social setting. They fell off their chair and experienced vivid visual sensations including colorful, rotating geometric shapes that felt physically tangible. The participant had no memory of their body or surroundings and felt as if they were embedded within this alien dimension. There was a continuous tumbling sensation which they encouraged, feeling both victorious and worried. After about 20 minutes, the spinning stopped, and the participant regained awareness of their environment, shouting in astonishment.

The participant then smoked another hit while lying down, experiencing disorientation and a peculiar sensation that a word was curving out into the plants of a greenhouse, creating the world as a semantic flourish. The experience slowly faded as they returned to baseline.

In the second experience, after consuming some mushrooms and cider at a woodland party, the participant took several hits of nitrous oxide but did not achieve an interesting effect. They then smoked 0.15g of the substance in isolation under a tree. Again, they could not remember breathing out. The participant felt as if they were somersaulting or turning inside out while being sliced into layers by a moving border that cut through their body and other substances like wood and stone. This process was frightening but seemed to be happening whether they liked it or not.

The participant struggled with aligning the cross sections of themselves, sometimes enthusiastically laying down new layers and at other times despairing. They felt as if they might never return to a familiar place and experienced emotional anguish over potentially losing their family and friends forever. The space was vast, colorful, and full of strange sounds and words.

Gradually, the participant began to feel more familiar spaces around them but remained scared that the process would not fully complete. After returning to baseline, they noticed their coat and bag were gone and initially believed they had been robbed. However, upon realizing they were under a different tree with their belongings 40 meters away, they felt as if the world had folded up and reconstituted in a different configuration."
775,58900,"The individual began by taking an unnamed substance in powder form, followed by smoking it mixed with tobacco and salvia extract. After consuming the salvia extract, they experienced immediate visual distortions and felt their surroundings tilting. They reported feeling as if they were part of a grid made up of blue cubes and had a sense of being mechanical rather than human. An entity to their left was described as having a slabbed back and expressing distress at the narrator's state.

The experience lasted approximately 7 seconds before the individual sat up, experiencing disorientation for about 10 seconds after which they regained some control. The comedown period lasted around 4 minutes."
776,78989,"The individual experienced a sensation of being trapped in a perpetual moment, feeling overwhelmed by dissatisfaction and horror at the realization that their life was merely a broken record, repeating endlessly. They felt ashamed for believing they could be complete or fully aware. An unknown presence ridiculed their attempts to escape this cycle. The participant then realized they were more than just a sound or a fan blade and saw themselves as a person. However, they still longed for satisfaction and the ability to progress through moments. After what seemed like an indeterminate period, they returned to reality, standing on their bed with difficulty, staring at a blue wall. They turned off the music and tried to integrate their experience, feeling grateful to be back in reality."
777,57160,"The individual began their experience in a small shed, where they smoked a substance using a water pipe. After inhaling deeply, they felt heavy legs and experienced visual distortions such as dancing colors and designs when their eyes were closed. The effects were mild at first but intensified later that day when the person tried a larger dose alone.

In the second experience, the individual found themselves in an extremely dark environment, feeling restrained by what seemed like a blanket. They perceived voices becoming clearer over time, along with the sensation of being pulled down into darkness by unseen hands and arms. The voices were heard saying things like ""Don't let him get away"" and ""He is slipping.""

The person managed to reach towards a light source, which revealed small plants that they initially thought were blackberry bushes but later realized were actually part of their shed setup. They felt as if the walls of the shed were flexible and could tear and mend themselves. The struggle continued with the individual being pulled through the floor and then under a bed at home, where family members appeared to be trying to pull them out.

Throughout this experience, the person kept reaching towards the light, which they believed was their only hope. After what seemed like 20-30 minutes of intense struggle, they managed to get close enough to the light source and recognized it as a plant grow light in their shed. Rationality began to return at this point, and the individual realized that much of what they had experienced was an illusion.

The entire experience lasted no more than five minutes but felt much longer due to its intensity."
778,57466,"The individual sat outside at a friend's house and consumed a substance, leading to immediate visual hallucinations. They perceived themselves as two faces: one yellow and one blue, which were connected and rotating within a spherical environment. The world was described as bright and vibrant, covering the entire visual field. Initially, they felt great sorrow and terror upon realizing that this experience might be eternal.

The individual then managed to gain control over one of the faces (the yellow one) and briefly saw people standing around them in reality. They communicated with these individuals but found it difficult to pronounce words correctly. As time passed, they were able to maintain a connection to reality while still experiencing hallucinations. The person reassured their friends that they would be okay and asked them not to touch or speak to them.

The experience eventually faded, leaving the individual with a strong body sensation described as ""tv static."" They did not consider it a bad trip but found it very intense and initially terrifying before remembering it was caused by a drug."
779,57345,"The participant began their experience by inhaling a large amount of vapor from a homemade bong, which quickly induced intense effects. They felt as though reality was moving in slow motion and experienced a strong sensation of acceleration through space before entering a state of darkness and emptiness. In this state, they perceived themselves as becoming part of eternity, stretching their consciousness over the universe.

As the experience progressed, the participant noticed that the darkness around them began to take on physical properties, forming boundaries and eventually breaking apart into colorful fragments representing different parts of their body. These fragments included yellow hands attempting to hug and massage the participant, blue heads expressing concern, and red heads appearing angry. The participant's consciousness continued to integrate these fragmented pieces until they reformed as a cohesive entity.

The experience concluded with the participant opening their eyes, feeling awe and wonder at what they had experienced."
780,55217,"The individual prepared for their first experience with a substance by setting up a dimly lit room and rehearsing the procedure with a sitter. They inhaled the substance through a bong multiple times, holding each inhalation for at least 30 seconds. Initially, they did not feel any significant effects due to water being present in the bong, which was later removed. After inhaling several times without water, they experienced reduced motor skills and a slight difference in sensation on one side of their face. They also heard a clock ticking more distinctly than usual and had vague dreamlike thoughts related to a carnival ride. However, these effects were not overwhelming, and the individual did not experience any significant hallucinations or altered states of consciousness as expected from the substance."
781,56138,"The narrator smoked a substance with two friends in their living room. After inhaling, they immediately felt a shift, becoming heavy and warm in their chair. They perceived infinite layers peeling away from reality, each layer containing an image of the room's contents. The narrator saw one friend, L, on these layers smiling at them.

The narrator tried to communicate but found it difficult to articulate what was happening. They stood up, moved around, and felt as if they were touching the visual layers with their hands, though they couldn't see their own hands. The experience felt completely real yet illogical, causing confusion about reality.

After a few minutes, the effects began to subside. The narrator felt stuck in their chair and had difficulty relaxing or moving comfortably. They walked outside for fresh air but remained preoccupied by the trip's intensity. When they returned, they discussed the experience with a friend who arrived later."
782,56085,"The participant began experiencing effects almost immediately after smoking the substance. They felt a prickly sensation all over their body followed by profuse sweating, particularly in their legs and forehead. A pulling force was perceived from different directions: initially from the right side, then below them, and finally to their left.

During this experience, the individual had hallucinations of being absorbed into a crudely drawn or painted cartoon street sign, similar to the Sesame Street logo. They felt as though they were becoming part of the sign and might ""drown"" in it if it reached above their neck. The sensation was accompanied by phrases like trying to convince an unseen force to take them with them and asking where they were going.

The participant remained lucid throughout, aware of both the hallucinations and their surroundings. They removed their pants due to discomfort caused by sweating and later felt cold from a fan, which may have helped ground them back into reality. The experience left them feeling heavy-headed for nearly an hour after the effects subsided."
783,55996,"BodyMe and a companion traveled to a cottage during winter, started a fire, and prepared for an experience. In a dark cabin illuminated only by three lit incense sticks, BodyMe smoked the substance from a pipe twice. He entered a state of hyper-awareness where his soul seemed to move downward into his skin and chair.

Visuals emerged as he drifted away from consciousness, entering what felt like a pre-death or enlightenment state. Voices approached him before he saw them; one prominent female entity spoke clearly and loudly. She questioned BodyMe about his life, addressing personal fears and inactivity. The entity made BodyMe sing with her rhythmically, causing him to chant and surrender.

BodyMe perceived a line extending from his heart, glistening like skin and pointing upwards. He was unsure if the entities left together or separately after their interaction. As they floated away, he saw the incense sticks as points of orientation, reminiscent of earlier visuals. The experience ended with BodyMe feeling dazed but pleased to return to his surroundings.

BodyMe noted that daytime use could be less enjoyable due to physical discomfort and a sense of being unable to function normally after the peak effects wore off."
784,77007,"The participant chewed fresh leaves of an unspecified substance and experienced strong effects in darkness with minimal sound. They reported perceiving a sub/super/transcendent reality, which they believe is concurrent with daily life but usually not perceived due to the dominance of ego-consciousness. The experience allowed them access to what they described as a larger 'holographic reality,' where they felt interconnected with their surroundings and other consciousnesses."
785,55265,"The individual experienced two distinct trips after consuming an unknown substance. In the first trip, while at work, the walls and floors disappeared, leaving only a black void with desks and coworkers still present. The desks rearranged into a cone shape with the participant at the top looking down on everyone else, but normal conversation continued as if nothing had changed. 

In the second trip, the individual found themselves high above ground on what appeared to be another planet, characterized by basic colors without shades. They were part of an enormous being, approximately 100 feet tall, wearing a gray plaid uniform and having a child-like face similar to those in the Pink Floyd ""Another Brick in the Wall"" music video. The participant felt a strong sense of evil emanating from this entity.

Inside the creature's body, which lacked organs but was filled with people, the individual experienced what seemed like being inside its stomach. The creature had an injury on its abdomen that appeared to be healing. As it ran back towards a school-like structure, the voices of other beings communicated their joy at the participant becoming part of them and warned that leaving would cause harm.

The participant managed to separate from this entity, experiencing sharp pains in the back of their head as if tearing themselves away. They returned to their physical body on the couch, feeling tingling sensations all over and covered in goosebumps."
786,55181,"The individual prepared for their experience by setting up a comfortable environment with pillows and a digital clock. They smoked three doses of an unknown substance over about 3 minutes. After the second dose, they felt a strong gravitational force pulling them down and experienced increased heart rate. With closed eyes, they saw dream-like images that were not vivid or clear but understood as hallucinations.

The first image was of purple dinosaur-like creatures flying through the sky and one telling a joke to another running a store. The individual laughed at this scene. Next, they saw a boy pulling colorful snakes out of long tubes which transformed into an otter or seal swimming in a sparkling ocean. They also heard their friend put down a soda can.

The physical sensations included a pulsating feeling throughout the body and a gravitational force pushing them to the ground. These effects gradually subsided over about 10 minutes, after which they felt relaxed but back to normal. The individual could only focus on one thing at a time for an hour afterward."
787,54341,"The participant experienced intense bodily sensations and perceived themselves as a small speck without a body, traveling along a new plane of reality where time and space were distorted. They felt carried or pushed through this altered dimension, unable to control their movement. The environment seemed familiar yet strange, with walls, ceiling, and floor merging into one.

During the experience, the participant heard voices of family and friends encouraging them to pass through a wall of cubes, suggesting everyone had to endure this journey. There were sensations of intense pressure, as if being forced into the neck of a bottle or zipped up in a jacket. The participant tossed items from their pockets onto the floor but did not recall why.

As the effects wore off, the participant felt extreme relief and enjoyed the post-trip introspection more than the peak experience, which was frightening due to its bizarre nature. Friends reported that the participant slid around the bed and tried to climb under it during the trip, though the participant does not remember these actions."
788,53796,"The participant had two experiences with an unnamed substance in Vienna, Austria, while staying at a hotel with friends. During the first hit, they experienced forgetting their surroundings and felt themselves vibrating. They saw walls extending endlessly in all directions and felt part of these patterns but could not make much sense of it.

Thirty minutes later, after discussing the initial experience, the participant took another hit. This time, they entered a vast world of whiteness where 3D sentences formed from visual patterns created by people present, including themselves and their mother. A higher being spoke through these sentences, which floated off into space like in Star Wars. The participant heard a continuous terrifying laugh from this entity.

The experience ended with the participant feeling part of the sentences and fearing death as they were pulled away into nothingness before returning to earth. For an hour after the trip, they felt distant from earthly complexities and wrote three pages of poems and lyrics in their journal during the aftermath."
789,53816,"The participant had their first encounter with an unknown extract of a substance while at a hotel room with friends. They took two large hits from a bowl, which caused immediate and intense effects. The individual felt as if their body was sliced into layers and then reassembled, leading to confusion and fear. Communication became difficult; they could not understand questions directed at them and repeatedly responded with ""Do what?"" The experience lasted about 2 minutes but seemed much longer due to its intensity. After the initial effects subsided, the room appeared to be warping and swirling, though communication gradually improved. The participant felt hot and sweaty afterward and returned to normal activities by the next morning. Other individuals in the room also experienced varying degrees of effects from the substance, with some having enjoyable experiences and others, like the participant, experiencing fear and confusion."
790,53503,"The participant had two separate experiences involving the substance. During the first experience, while sitting under a tree in light rain, they heard a voice commanding them to take additional hits from the bong. After inhaling more, their vision broke into fractals, and they perceived a cartoonish face on the tree above them. A loud taunting laugh was heard but not by their friend who was nearby. The participant felt stiff and sore in areas where they had been exercising before the trip.

In the second experience, near a creek, the participant saw a strange fly hovering around the bong bowl. They heard an entity introduce itself as ""spiritual satan"" and say it would take them to hell. After inhaling from the larger bong, their vision again broke into fractals, even with eyes closed. The sounds around them also rearranged themselves into what sounded like music from a mid-eighties video game with a haunting childlike tone. They perceived an entity resembling ""Lady Salvia,"" but felt more as if they were interacting with many small, evil beings.

Upon opening their eyes at the end of the second experience, the participant saw their friends' bodies and faces as though made of clay, perceiving them as designed creations rather than products of evolution."
791,53484,"The participant entered a room with a chair and a bong, smoked the substance, and immediately fell to the floor. They experienced a prickling sensation spreading throughout their body. Initially, they felt paranoid and confused but then became disoriented and began questioning the nature of existence and memory. The individual visualized thoughts collapsing into themselves in a layered manner.

They perceived the room's texture as small chain links forming the fabric of reality and felt trapped in a confined space. At one point, they imagined being coated by a thick plastic substance that immobilized them. They slipped in and out of consciousness, experiencing gravity pulling them down and hearing a buzzing sound from a fan.

The participant returned to awareness when their friend asked if they were okay. They requested cool music and recognized the dog and his mother as grounded entities. The experience lasted approximately 30-45 minutes but felt much longer. Upon reviewing video footage, it was noted that the individual initially knelt next to the chair, then stood up rapidly, showing fear and confusion.

The overall impression was one of spirituality and ominous thoughts, with a feeling of knowing what it's like to die while conscious. The participant felt disconnected and somewhat meaningless afterward."
792,53433,"The user began by inhaling smoke from a substance through a water pipe using a butane torch lighter. Shortly after inhalation, they experienced visual distortions characterized by pixelated edges around objects in bright green/purple/yellow colors and crackling noises. They felt their body twisting counterclockwise and becoming rubbery.

A woman's voice began whispering ""Why don't you come with me?"" followed by a drum-like sound. The user saw entities forming from the scenery, inviting them to join. They managed to move inside, where they observed vivid, 3D visuals on their computer screen. A presence was felt behind them, occasionally merging with the individual and intensifying the effects.

The experience gradually stabilized and ""hardened,"" leading to a light-headed feeling as reality returned."
793,52904,"The narrator and their friend J smoked a combination of marijuana and salvia extract on Class & Charter day at college. The narrator experienced everything inorganic as stiff canvas and people as soft pima cotton, connected by zippers that could be operated with the mind. They felt an urgent need to escape being ""zipped into nothingness."" J's experience involved a world resembling a children's book with cardboard pages, rapidly flipped through by an external force, taking slices of him along. Both individuals were terrified during their trips but later returned for smaller doses to better control the experience."
794,52671,"The individual experienced an out-of-body sensation where they felt their consciousness rising away from their physical form. They found themselves in a fantastical environment populated by small entities resembling elves or gnomes. These entities were described as having square shoulders, straight arms, pointed hats, beards, elven ears and noses, but no faces or mouths. The setting was whimsical with gingerbread houses and candy canes, and everything had a soft, foam-like texture.

The participant communicated with these entities through thought and directed their physical body to cough and swallow when the elves indicated it needed attention. After some time in this state, the individual slowly returned to their physical form, hovering just above their body before fully re-entering it. Upon returning, they felt disoriented but continued to experience visual ripples on the walls."
795,52513,"The individual began experiencing unusual sensations in a dimly lit room after inhaling an unknown substance. They found themselves within a complex mechanical system, turning large gears with their hands despite feeling they had no control over the action. Their visual perception became distorted; it appeared as though their legs were either flowing up into or pouring down from the ceiling fan. The participant heard multiple voices, including one distinct higher-pitched voice repeating ""He doesn't even know what he's doing!!"" They attempted to achieve a deeper state by shutting off lights and closing blinds but only partially succeeded in visualizing their body turning green with an energy/spirit before coming back to reality."
796,51013,"The participant smoked a small amount (approximately 0.4 grams) of an extract from a substance in a chillum pipe with friends present. The smoke was harsh, but manageable. Initially, they experienced a gradual onset of pleasant sensations including relaxation, disorientation, and contentment, similar to being slightly high on marijuana.

As the effects progressed, visual hallucinations became more noticeable but were subtle and controllable. With eyes closed, the participant perceived colors, shapes, and patterns that seemed to dance along with music. They felt a desire for broader vision and an expanded understanding of their surroundings. Opening their eyes occasionally brought them back to a milder high state.

The experience lasted approximately 1.5 hours from smoking until falling asleep, during which time they maintained control over the intensity of their hallucinations by opening or closing their eyes. Motor skills were minimally affected, and there was a fleeting sense of time and location. The next morning, no effects were noticed."
797,43964,"The participant began to feel disoriented after inhaling the substance, experiencing the room as if it were tilted 90 degrees. They struggled with balance and had a sensation of crawling on what they perceived as the wall. The participant heard children's music and felt an urge to escape the room. Upon moving into the hallway, which appeared extremely long with bright white walls, the music faded away.

The individual experienced a strong body buzz and felt disconnected from their usual self, believing they were from another universe and had switched bodies with an alien being. They perceived humans as a threat and decided not to reveal this belief immediately. The participant then sat on a bed, feeling surrounded by the universe and watched over by a higher being.

Physical sensations included an unfamiliar face, cold hands, and constant pressure from gravity. Realization of hallucination set in gradually, with full recovery taking about an hour."
798,43949,"The individual began their experience by inhaling a substance and immediately felt disoriented and confused. Their vision became distorted, with objects appearing farther apart than they actually were. They experienced difficulty in performing simple tasks such as placing items back in their proper locations. The environment seemed frightening due to the music playing, which intensified their sense of unease.

The participant's head felt heavy, and they described a sensation of their brain extending out of their ears. They felt detached from their body, similar to being between asleep and awake states. Panic set in as they worried about never returning to normalcy. To alleviate this, they attempted to get fresh air outside but continued to feel disoriented.

Returning inside, the participant took a shower hoping it would help them regain clarity. However, visual distortions persisted even during this activity. After approximately one hour, the effects began to subside, and the individual returned to their normal state of mind."
799,42985,"Three friends gathered to try a new psychedelic substance. They smoked it in turns using a water bong. The first friend reported feeling physically heavy and struggling to move. He felt as if he was being pulled into his mattress and eventually onto the floor, becoming disoriented and unable to communicate clearly.

The narrator then took a hit and experienced a tingling sensation followed by uncontrollable laughter. His body became stiff, and he engaged in repetitive head movements with another friend who seemed entranced. The effects were intense but short-lived, lasting about 10 minutes before wearing off.

Later that evening, they decided to try again at a secluded park. The narrator took the first hit and immediately felt detached from his body, experiencing a sense of endless despair as if he had been split in half vertically. He rolled on the ground uncontrollably for several minutes while his friends watched. Upon regaining some awareness, he was confused, cold, sweaty, and frightened.

The other two friends described the narrator's behavior during this period, noting that he appeared terrified and disoriented. They reassured him about what had happened and helped him regain a sense of reality. The narrator felt anxious and embarrassed but eventually calmed down with the help of marijuana."
800,68187,"The individual was alone at home when they began experiencing visual hallucinations after consuming an unspecified substance. They perceived their surroundings merging with parts of their body, creating a surreal environment where they felt trapped in a cone-shaped reality. The point of this cone appeared to be defined by the index finger of their outstretched left arm, and they could feel a thin line running down that arm.

As the individual tried to roll away from this perceived reality, they noticed bits and pieces of their body emerging as expressions behind them, forming parts of their living room. They heard sounds similar to bricks forming a road as they moved, which later turned out to be the sound of them trashing their apartment. The participant began panicking and crying for help.

Entities that the individual thought were observing them communicated with him, identifying him as Daniel Kelly and suggesting he roll back into the expressions left behind by his rolling. This action helped the individual feel more integrated but eventually stopped due to obstacles in the living room. The participant became increasingly worried about their situation, believing they had been evacuated from an illusion of reality into a true one.

The experience included seeing multiple expressions of their face on different objects in the room and crying out for help simultaneously with these expressions. After some time, the individual bent their arm so that their finger touched their nose, which helped them regain awareness of their surroundings. They found their living room trashed, with furniture overturned and items scattered.

The participant spent 20 minutes walking around, repeating expletives about the experience, unable to fully comprehend what had happened."
801,42859,"The participant visited a friend's house after purchasing a substance from a smoke shop. They waited for another person who did not show up before beginning their experience. The first user smoked a portion of the substance, experiencing physical sensations and brief hallucinations before returning to normalcy. 

Next, the participant took a larger dose and immediately felt an intense physical sensation described as a twisting feeling inside their torso. As they exhaled, colors obscured their vision, and they lost all sense of identity, time, and place. The only constant was the presence of their friend by the window, whom they perceived as responsible for their altered state.

During this period, the participant felt like an enormous joke had been played on them and experienced a female presence that infused everything. They laughed hysterically throughout the experience while trying to make sense of the insane universe around them. The room appeared bigger, and at one point, they saw a word or pattern in red floating past their head.

The experience ended abruptly as the participant snapped back to reality, regaining awareness of who they were, where they were, and what had happened."
802,42344,"The participant inhaled an unspecified substance using a bong and experienced immediate effects after exhaling. They felt two presences or bodies while holding in the smoke. Upon exhaling, they were suddenly launched into what seemed like another world, losing consciousness for about 20-40 minutes during which time approximately 25 minutes of movie had passed. When regaining consciousness, the participant was confused and disoriented, feeling as if it was their first time seeing their surroundings despite being familiar with them. They experienced visual distortions, a tingling sensation throughout their body, pressure on the front side of their body making breathing difficult, sweating, and discomfort from the texture of the couch. The participant stood up quickly, still confused about what had happened, and walked to the kitchen where they briefly thought someone was there before realizing they were alone. They returned to the living room, breathed deeply, and gradually regained some sense of reality while continuing to feel uneasy. After lying down in bed for 20-40 minutes, the physical discomforts subsided, leaving a heavy-headed feeling similar to marijuana. The participant fell asleep eventually and later that day took smaller doses of the substance which were milder and shorter-lasting."
803,42261,"The individual began their experience in a friend's house after smoking an unknown substance. They felt as though their body was covered in plastic controlled by someone else, leading to discomfort and difficulty moving between furniture. Their arm fused to the table, and they experienced contorted body shapes and a sensation of having eyes in their mouth.

Visual hallucinations included energies drifting across the ceiling that the participant manipulated into a starfish shape. The skin felt stiff and uncomfortable, resembling armor. They observed friends talking to a door with Kenny's head on it and heard pounding behind a sheet covering a window, which turned out to be a normal window.

The individual encountered four unfamiliar people in the living room, one of whom was previously attractive but now looked unfamiliar. They were held back from approaching these individuals due to fear. The cat attacked someone's hand, causing bleeding, but no action was taken by others present.

In the bedroom, they saw a bug that moved closer and felt it had many legs blending into the carpet. The rug appeared like a jungle. Tribal drums could be heard in the distance. They also experienced discomfort from their skin not fitting properly and itching.

After the trip began to wear off, the participant found a nickel in their pocket and observed its fall, imagining themselves flipping into the air like it did. They covered their eyes with palms due to sensitivity to sunlight outside, feeling as though they were invincible and could control everything around them, including breathing fire onto others.

The experience concluded with a reflective state where the individual felt calm and wrote a poem on their handheld device about being invincible and controlling the sun's effects."
804,63547,"In a dimly lit room with soft music playing, the individual experiences vivid imagery upon inhalation. They encounter multiple characters who resemble Sesame Street muppets, each wearing white painter suits and displaying primary colors. These characters are conscious entities that rotate in a snowflake-like pattern, connected by hands or feet.

The setting initially appears as a bright white grocery store aisle, which morphs into the hall of their first church, with subtle changes to the surroundings. The participant feels pressure on their jaw and lips, accompanied by a synesthetic sensation where they can see, feel, and smell this pressure in relation to the characters' colors.

The characters are welcoming and encourage the individual to stay or bring them back to reality. However, the participant struggles to communicate about the other world effectively. The environment of the new world adopts simple colors and clean lines, similar to cutout stickers, with a Sesame Street aesthetic.

Closing their eyes reveals a three-dimensional shadow of one of these characters ironing something, formed by the light from the computer screen. Sounds remain largely unchanged but the characters are described as familiar yet annoyingly playful.

The imagery eventually leads the participant back to memories associated with their childhood church bathroom, where they recall an embarrassing incident involving soiling themselves and seeking help from their father. This memory is significant to them, though the journey through the visual jungle was confusing and somewhat disappointing in achieving deeper insights."
805,60777,"The participant began their experience feeling apprehensive but ready. They felt larger than normal when sitting on the bed, describing it as being on a ""throne."" After inhaling the substance for the first time, they experienced a heightened awareness of reality and enjoyed this state. The second hit caused some coughing, which briefly interrupted the high.

During the third hit, the participant had difficulty holding back intense coughing fits but remained aware even with their eyes closed. They perceived themselves as part of a larger entity, akin to being on its skin, maintaining its life force. When the sitter prepared for a stronger dose (25x), the participant laughed and ran to the bathroom, still highly amused.

The fourth hit was smooth, while the fifth caused difficulty lighting the substance due to the lighter's malfunctioning. After inhaling this strong dose, the participant closed their eyes and entered a dark dimension filled with entities. They felt guided by a main entity or friend within this space. The experience then shifted to a serene beach setting where they perceived an angelic figure.

The participant was taken through elastic-like extensions of time and space, visiting places related to their subconscious thoughts, including a retail establishment where someone had expressed interest in them. Upon regaining physical awareness, the sitter reported that the participant had been speaking with someone while their eyes were closed, asking if they could go anywhere they wanted.

The experience concluded around 2:45 PM when the participant returned to the kitchen, feeling slightly nauseous due to fasting before the session."
806,51966,"The participant smoked a substance and experienced an altered state of consciousness. They felt as if they were floating in space, surrounded by galaxies and stars. A humanoid entity appeared beside them, resembling a wizard with a long grey beard. This entity communicated telepathically, explaining that spirit travel is possible within each person. The user also saw a portal shaped like their own body, through which they could see their reality back home, including another individual holding the smoking device used for the substance."
807,50903,"The participant attended a large party at their girlfriend's house and decided to smoke an extracted form of a hallucinogen with a friend. After inhaling the substance, they immediately lost touch with reality. They remember sitting at a picnic table where a giant brick wall suddenly appeared and enveloped their friend, causing them to attempt to pull him out while he laughed hysterically.

The participant wandered away from the table, unable to comprehend when people called his name. They saw waves of music emanating from speakers and felt compelled to stop someone dancing by turning off the stereo, believing they had saved the world from destruction. About 15 minutes later, the effects began to subside, but their friend was still heavily affected, stating that another person had turned into a deck of cards."
808,41321,"The participant began by chewing a quid made from about two grams of plain leaves soaked in water with some Copenhagen for flavor. They noticed strange sensations, slight visual changes, hot and cold flashes after an hour. However, the effects were less pronounced than expected due to smoking pot beforehand and engaging in other activities.

About 1.5 hours into the experience, they felt their thoughts became ordered but with an 'alien' theme, and mild visual disturbances unlike anything else experienced before. They decided to stop at this point as it was becoming uncomfortable.

Later that evening, the participant smoked a single plain leaf from their waterpipe. Upon inhalation, they felt a silent buzzing and electrical vibrations. Their vision took on a gray silvery tone with blurred edges. A female entity in her late 20s or early 30s appeared behind them, pulling on their face while their body moved but not their head.

The participant then left the room to check for smoke from the oven, which was emitting smoke due to an uncleaned spill. They heard a voice say, ""Don't leave, don't leave."" The experience ended with a pre-teleportation gravity buzz and a vulnerable infantile state marking the return to reality.

The next day, they felt fine and were in a good mood."
809,41282,"The individual started by using a small amount of the substance, experiencing mild body high and confusion. Later, they used a larger dose through a bong, leading to a deeper detachment from reality. The experience was characterized by an overwhelming feeling of slipping away from baseline consciousness into what they referred to as ""salvia space."" In this state, everything seemed unfamiliar and new, including the sense of touch.

The participant walked around the room while in this altered state, with their surroundings becoming increasingly distorted and foreign. They had difficulty comprehending their actual location and the presence of others. As the effects began to wear off, they experienced a pendulum-like swing between reality and confusion. The music playing in the background seemed to guide them as an unnamed force.

The experience was described as intense and different from other hallucinogens like LSD or shrooms, which only distort reality through visuals and heightened emotions. This substance transported the individual to a completely different reality quickly but briefly."
810,51891,"The participant began by meditating for about 15 minutes before smoking Salvia divinorum. After inhaling the smoke, they experienced rapid onset of effects characterized by spinning sensations and visual distortions. They found themselves on what appeared to be a wooden merry-go-round with eight to nine people smiling and laughing around them. One man in a white shirt and jeans tried to get the participant to stand up.

The participant then realized they were not actually on a merry-go-round but rather in their living room, where they saw their carpet and blanket. They felt disoriented and wondered if others could see them in this state. The visual hallucinations included seeing people walking around in circles and disappearing when turned away from. At one point, the participant attempted to return to lying down on pillows but found it difficult due to the spinning sensation.

Eventually, they managed to lie face down and experienced closed-eye visuals (CEVs) similar to those encountered with DXM. These CEVs were described as bubbly, gooey, moving, and flowing colors. As the peak effects subsided, the participant opened their eyes and found that the visual hallucinations had ceased, though some disorientation remained.

The participant noticed that they had knocked over an ash tray during the experience and saw two black marks on the carpet, one of which was a pile of ashes and another perceived as a burn mark. Upon standing up, these marks were no longer visible. The participant also experienced brief random images when closing their eyes, such as a woman at a desk, a train, and a large box hanging from a ceiling.

The experience concluded with the realization that they had inhaled an entire bowl of Salvia divinorum without exhaling it first."
811,56674,"The participant smoked a small amount of dried plant material with a friend present. After inhaling the smoke, they immediately collapsed onto the floor for about 30 seconds before regaining consciousness. Upon waking, they experienced intense visual and auditory hallucinations. The walls and ceiling appeared to curve inwards and upwards in impossible ways, and the wooden floor was covered in swirling geometric patterns of intense colors.

The participant felt as though their body had separated from itself and was observing the scene from above. They perceived their friend as an all-knowing entity and were unsure if he was a friend or foe. The participant's fingers, hands, and body seemed to be melting into the floor, becoming one with it. A strange voice repeated a phrase that sounded like ""Da dum, da dum, be dum,"" which the patterns on the floor appeared to swirl in response.

As the experience intensified, the participant felt as though they were being sucked into a black hole or whirlpool in the center of the room, worried about being crushed and compacted infinitely small. The voice became louder and more frantic until it was just white noise and a shrill screeching vibration. After 10 minutes, the effects subsided, and the participant returned to normal."
812,49984,"The user, an experienced drug user, initially tried Salvia divinorum in leaf form with minimal effects but later experimented with a 20x extract. After taking one hit from a small pipe, they felt strong effects within 15 seconds and peaked within 45 seconds. The experience was described as intense and disorienting, similar to a mushroom trip but more rapid onset.

Visual distortions included blurring vision, walls and carpets switching colors, and flowers on the carpet turning into dots that imprinted on everything viewed. When closing their eyes, they experienced mind-racing thoughts and confusion about time and surroundings. The user felt their house was tilted, and the room seemed smaller with vertically pulsing walls.

The trip lasted approximately 45 minutes but felt much shorter due to time distortion. They returned to normalcy after this period and were convinced of Salvia's power, considering a future attempt with two hits."
813,39131,"The participant returned home after a difficult day at work and decided to partake in an herbal substance with their roommate. They prepared for the experience by weighing out a precise dose of approximately 50mg and combining it with another plant material before smoking it. As the effects set in, they felt debilitated and experienced a rapid onset that left them overwhelmed.

The participant described entering a dark void where they felt cold and scared, as if being pulled down by icy hands. They then saw a pinprick of light that expanded into a cityscape, which morphed and changed shape rapidly. The city appeared to be alive but devoid of people, with buildings disintegrating and roads flowing like water.

As the experience began to fade, memories of reality started to return, and the participant regained their senses. They blinked and saw the ceiling again, along with their friend who had been waiting for them to come back from the trip. The friend asked how it was, and the participant requested a few minutes to regain composure before continuing."
814,63029,"The participant began the day by consuming a substance containing mescaline, followed by smoking marijuana later in the afternoon. They also consumed salvia divinorum multiple times throughout the day. The effects of the first substance were slow to manifest but eventually produced an intense energy surge and euphoria, accompanied by visual distortions such as swirling ceilings. The participant experienced difficulty eating due to the energetic state.

Later, at a bridge near their house, they smoked marijuana with friends and consumed salvia divinorum again. During this session, the participant reported profound experiences including feeling connected to everything in the universe and noticing the weight of sunlight. Friends also tried salvia but did not report significant effects.

After returning home, the participant continued to experience strong visual distortions and a sense of euphoria for several hours. They attended family night at rehab while still under the influence, where they participated actively despite the ongoing visuals and sensations.

The trip lasted nearly 12 hours with no harsh comedown or negative aftereffects reported by the participant."
815,37632,"The individual experienced a strong effect after inhaling the substance, feeling a tingle on their side and sinking into the ground while lying in bed. They saw brown-colored gears rotating counter-clockwise as they descended into an underground space. The room above was drifting away from them, and they continued to descend through multiple 'underground floors' with increasing numbers of gears until reaching what appeared to be the core of the Earth. At this point, there was a bright red light, and invisible beings were present around the individual. These entities were described as omnipresent and unseen, making faint whispers. The participant felt like one of them and laughed, feeling at home in this underground space."
816,38123,"The participant began their experience by attempting to take an undiluted dose but found it too harsh for their tongue, so they diluted subsequent doses. They experienced a state of relaxation and heaviness, with a warm sensation spreading up their legs. As the effects intensified, they felt increasingly detached from their body.

A shadow-like entity appeared behind them, communicating telepathically that by the time it completed its circular path around the participant, they would be in a different place. The shadow moved at the participant's pace and formed a dark circle with a radar-like line as it circled back to its starting point.

Upon completion of this process, the participant saw their room transformed into a lush jungle filled with rich green plants, vines, and moss. This visual experience was vivid but would disappear if the participant tried to focus on specific details. The jungle vision alternated with the actual room view as the participant shifted between open-eyed and closed-eye states.

The participant also observed water flowing upwards in their room, resembling a clear mother of pearl color. These visions lasted for about 20-30 minutes during the peak experience, which was approximately one hour and thirty minutes long overall.

During this time, the participant felt no negative physical sensations or aftereffects, only a refreshing sense of clarity. They reflected on the experience as profound and life-changing, noting that focusing too much on specific details can obscure the beauty and truth of the whole picture."
817,38567,"The individual began their session by smoking four hits of an unknown substance. After the first two hits, they felt more aware and alert, with a sense of being able to learn large amounts of information quickly. Following the last two hits, they observed three or four 2D figures dancing on a table in front of them.

The participant then experienced a separation between their head and vision, seeing themselves from a third-person perspective while laughing and losing balance. They felt playful and invincible in this flat, 2D world. An unknown being approached as sound, leading the individual through sharp corners made of noise before reality was stripped away into a void.

A red liquid then filled the void, and the participant floated aimlessly until an object melted onto their body, grounding them. They encountered a man who imparted knowledge that felt forbidden, causing the intensity to build until everything collapsed in on itself, resulting in a state of absolute nothingness. This intense experience gradually faded over 15-20 minutes."
818,38546,"The participant began the experience feeling lightheaded after inhaling the substance. They felt detached from their body and experienced profuse sweating. As the effects intensified, they perceived themselves as part of a static picture, unable to move without disappointing someone unseen. The user reported seeing God or a divine presence and communicated with this entity, asking if it was still there.

The participant then found themselves in what appeared to be a ballpark scene, but felt more like being part of a postcard held by a hand wearing a white glove, possibly belonging to the divine figure they had previously perceived. They experienced stomach discomfort and a sense of falling rapidly while feeling detached from their body yet connected to it.

The user questioned religious beliefs and the nature of perception, wondering if the size or position of one's eyes controlled what could be seen. There was confusion about whether their eyes were open or closed due to everything appearing black. The participant also briefly considered the possibility that they might have been on heroin instead but dismissed this thought.

After a period of intense experience, the user returned to normal consciousness at around 10:19, having started the trip at 10:00."
819,48975,"The participant began by administering a substance using a hand-bong in their tiled bathroom. Upon inhalation, they experienced a strong physical sensation described as an electric surge through their body. They observed that the tiles around them appeared like tiny hallways extending deeper into space. In the mirror, they saw themselves and felt unable to speak, resorting to barking sounds instead.

The participant then stripped naked and entered a shower, where water felt like sand ripping through their skin. Hundreds of small people emerged from their body and danced on the floor. They became increasingly fearful about the experience and noted that outlines were sparkling. The square tiles in the bathroom began moving rapidly around them until they closed their eyes.

In this state, the participant floated in space, worried about losing their memories. Suddenly, they found themselves back in bed, dry and dressed, with music playing. They felt off-peak but regaining normalcy quickly. Their heart raced, and they stayed awake all night due to fear of not waking up if they closed their eyes.

The next morning, the participant woke up without knowing how they got out of the shower or back into bed."
820,48032,"The participant began their experience in a dimly lit room with red lighting and soft music playing in the background. After consuming a small amount of the substance, they felt heavy and experienced creeping feelings around them. They saw things in the corner of their eyes and had precognitive visions of tribal scenes.

Taking a second dose led to more vivid experiences. The participant saw cartoon-like borders made up of elephants and flowers moving in straight lines. As they exhaled, they fell onto the bed feeling as though they were falling into a lake and became entangled in blankets, pushing them off as if they were evil. They also experienced a spinning school bus vortex that pulled them down with a tribal sensation.

After regaining some clarity, the participant went downstairs for food but remained disoriented. At 8:05 pm, they took another half bowl of the substance and lay back on their bed. This time, walls appeared to spin, taking on a yellow hue, and the vertical blinds melted downwards like crayons. The music gave them an eerie feeling, and they heard 'SELL IT ALL SELL IT ALL'. They regained control after about 25 minutes.

For the next hour, the participant felt edgy and off-balance but gradually returned to normal."
821,48203,"The participant reported two experiences with a substance that produced profound hallucinogenic effects. During the first experience, they felt intense bodily sensations as if their extremities were dissolving or being rubbed. Visual tracers appeared, and each movement seemed to unfold in an intricate manner, leading to a feeling of self-extension into everything around them. The participant expressed fear about the duration of these effects and advised against further use.

In the second experience, which occurred at a party, the participant felt as though they had transformed into a dog, wagging their tail (which was actually their leg in the air while lying on their back). They also noticed a door that previously wasn't there and pointed it out to others. The experience lasted approximately two minutes but seemed much longer due to time dilation effects.

The participant's girlfriend experienced mild irritability during both sessions but did not report significant hallucinations."
822,63968,"The participant prepared for their journey by cleaning their room, setting up soothing music, and using a combination of tincture and extract. After consuming the substance, they began to feel disconnected from their body and experienced difficulty in performing simple tasks like swallowing. They then smoked the extract through a water pipe.

During the experience, the individual felt as though they had become part of an intricate network or pattern, forming complex structures with other entities described as blue human figures. These entities were content with their roles but the participant yearned to return to their previous life as a human, feeling that this new existence was a lie and lacked the richness of emotions and free will.

The participant struggled between two realities: one where they were part of an alternate dimension and another which they considered their true identity. They attempted to break free from the otherworld by tearing themselves away from the network, causing physical disturbances in their room as they did so. To regain control, they turned on lights and watched a comedy DVD.

The experience was intense but manageable, allowing the participant to return to consensus reality with some effort. They felt enlightened by the encounter and gained a new perspective on overlapping realities and the nature of consciousness."
823,53502,"The participant experienced an unusual prolonged effect after using the substance. During their initial trip, they encountered difficulty lighting their pipe due to a malfunctioning lighter that would not ignite despite having gas and producing sparks. This led to feelings of confusion and detachment from reality. Over the following two weeks, the individual reported experiencing vivid insights and dreams, often feeling as though they were in a dream-like state or 'savality'. They noted persistent sensations of detachment and an ongoing sense that they could wake up at any moment.

In one particularly disturbing dream, the participant encountered cold entities moving past them, causing chills. These entities seemed to be communicating about someone upstairs, possibly referring to the user themselves. The dream also involved the sensation of their body passing through their wife's during movement, which was later revealed to have been a vivid hallucination upon waking.

The experience continued for two weeks with fluctuating intensity and included persistent feelings of detachment from reality and an ongoing sense that they were in a dream-like state or 'savality'."
824,63900,"The participant reported entering a profound altered state after inhaling salvia leaves. In this new reality, they experienced themselves as an alien newborn, progressing through almost their entire life cycle within minutes. The world was populated by green-skinned beings who communicated telepathically and valued knowledge over emotions like humor or anger.

The participant had a family unit of five in this alien society, including a mother figure. They were elected to a position of importance but eventually fell out of favor due to perceived failures. After what felt like one or two hundred years, the individual realized they had taken some kind of drug and found themselves back in their bed.

Post-trip, the participant experienced disorientation and an altered perception of reality for days afterward. They described everything as feeling new and somewhat fake but also incredibly vivid and satisfying."
825,61015,"The individual experienced vivid fractal patterns that seemed to extend infinitely in all directions. They perceived themselves as being pulled and twisted through these patterns, feeling a strong physical sensation akin to being combed or having something travel up their spine. The experience was devoid of emotional content but filled with a sense of eternal motion and repetition.

While immersed in this state, the participant remained aware of their friend holding their hand in the physical world on their right side. There was an overwhelming desire to stop moving through these fractal planes and find a more familiar or stable reality. The experience felt both profound and unnerving due to its endless nature and the sameness of each plane.

The individual also perceived a small bubble of brightness representing their usual reality, which they knew would return when they opened their eyes. There was a sense of reluctant attachment to this world despite understanding it as an illusion. When returning to normal consciousness, everything appeared intensely still and heavier, yet familiar in its unchanged state.

Philosophical reflections followed the experience, contemplating the nature of existence, consciousness, and the power of creation."
826,65501,"The participant experienced three sessions with a psychoactive substance. In the first session, they felt minimal effects and lasted about 10 minutes. During the second session, the participant had a vivid and frightening experience where they perceived themselves as being on a chopping block alongside thousands of chickens, facing death by a giant man wielding a meat cleaver. They remember grabbing their friend and rolling around on the ground in fear.

In the third session, the participant felt an intense struggle to maintain consciousness, experiencing blackness and screaming their name repeatedly while feeling as if they were slipping away. An arm appeared, which they recognized as their own, trying to pull them back into light. They perceived this moment as a near-death experience, filled with extreme emotion and fear of dying.

Upon regaining consciousness after the third session, the participant felt profound sadness and concluded that the substance did not agree with them."
827,48448,"The individual consumed a significant amount of an unspecified substance and prepared for the experience by setting up their environment with candles and closing the curtains. They began to feel physically intense effects shortly after consumption, including hallucinations such as seeing their pillow on fire. The participant managed to extinguish the flame before it spread.

During the peak of the experience, they encountered various entities in different realms. In one realm, there were non-human people who were supposed to come and get them but did not know they were present. Another entity was described as a ""brooding"" figure walking back and forth in the room. The participant also experienced visions of an olden or retro universe with light and childhood-like memories.

The substance-induced state included both fear and joy, with sensations ranging from cozy glee to intense paranoia. They felt certain that parts of their brain had been removed during one vision. As they came down from the experience, they were disturbed by being back in what seemed like a small realm compared to the expansive universe they had just visited.

The participant recorded their thoughts and experiences throughout the trip, noting physical sensations such as goosebumps and jittery tangles. They also described the substance's effects on their perception of time and reality, with music playing an important role in shaping these perceptions.

After the experience, the individual called a friend to confirm that it was indeed snowing outside, which they had not expected given the recent weather conditions before the trip began."
828,47029,"The user describes multiple experiences with the substance over several years. In early sessions, they felt slightly pushed to one side and giggled; their friend's hair appeared to leave trails of dark rainbows. On other occasions, they experienced temporary paralysis and saw what seemed like another dimension or plane before their eyes. During a stronger experience, they spoke in an unfamiliar language that flowed uncontrollably from their lips, which they referred to as 'speaking in tongues.' They managed to type some of these words on a computer during two separate sessions.

The user also mentions feeling as though they were being torn apart internally and seeing spiraling shapes similar to the Fibonacci ratio. This led to producing Salvia-influenced drawings. Each session began with an amnesia-like state where they blacked out before awakening in what felt like a more real world.

In their most intense experience, which occurred after a long break from use, auditory hallucinations were prominent, characterized by nonsensical words spoken rapidly and in reverse alphabetical order. The user felt as though their mind and body were completely separated from reality, leading to a terrifying sense of being held against their will in a strange place. They experienced an overwhelming desire to be alone and hide the substance.

After regaining some awareness of their surroundings, they walked around saying 'Oh my God' for many minutes, feeling that everything seemed unreal compared to where their mind had been. The user felt as though someone was watching them suffer and taking delight in it during this experience."
829,54040,"The participant consumed an unknown substance and experienced intense effects almost immediately. They felt disconnected from reality and observed a white ball forming in front of them, which represented their entire life, past, present, and future. The ball exploded when someone moved slightly, releasing organic matter that had not finished developing. The participant noticed the colors and objects in the room, including two recliners and a yellow container, and felt these items were part of an unfinished puzzle. They communicated briefly with others in the room but did not provide detailed descriptions of these entities beyond noting their presence and brief interactions. As they came back to reality, the participant reflected on the experience as an exploration into a divine and timeless reality."
830,48131,"The narrator watched two other people experience the effects of an unknown substance. Phil became disoriented and scared during his trip, while the sister remained serene but unable to walk normally. During the narrator's own trips, they experienced a sensation of their body feeling hard like plastic and saw a 'grid' in front of their eyes. They also heard voices and perceived themselves as different entities such as Walmart and shelves.

In one instance, the narrator felt as if they were being eaten and then became rooted to the ground, seeing the grid structure beneath them. They experienced becoming Walmart and hearing people's conversations, which was disorienting. Later, they became shelves in a store and heard children's voices, feeling fear about being taken off the shelf or not.

The narrator also perceived themselves as a coin-operated horsey machine, wanting a quarter to be inserted so that a little girl could ride it. They regained sobriety gradually, feeling sensations on their head such as a door sliding back into place and something with a tail moving on top of their head."
831,36088,"The participant was at a friend's house with three friends in a well-lit room. They smoked two large bowls of a substance through a bong and experienced effects almost immediately during the second bowl. The experience lasted about five minutes. During this time, they perceived masses of energy flowing through the room and themselves. These energies were sensed as shapes and felt as powerful but painless electrical fields. The participant believed these energies controlled their actions; for example, when a wall of energy passed through them, they laughed hysterically at a joke made by a friend.

The participant did not experience visual or auditory hallucinations but instead had an altered reality that felt normal to them. They could foresee the future based on the sensed energy and were intrigued by how logical their actions seemed despite feeling controlled by external forces. As the effects wore off, the perception of these energies disappeared, leaving the individual with a sense of having experienced something strange yet familiar."
832,53309,"The participant and their companion alternately inhale an unnamed substance. The first person experiences intense altered states of consciousness characterized by a state of non-existence followed by multiple dimensions or realities described as ""swirling color."" An external voice is heard commanding a return to normalcy. During one phase, an evil presence takes control of the narrator's body and attempts to escape from the room. The experience concludes with physical discomfort including hot flashes and sweating, along with a realization about the nature of reality."
833,35995,"The participant had two drug experiences in different settings with a fortified leaf substance. In the first setting, which was a bedroom with soft red lighting and nature sounds playing, the onset was brief, followed by visual patterns that rotated clockwise around them like a tunnel. The experience was interrupted when the participant heard their partner make a slight noise, after which they noticed physical sensations such as perspiration and prickling on the skin.

In the second setting, located in a living room with lava lamps, plasma lamps, and ambient music, the onset was again brief. This time, the participant saw a green plant behind the lava lamp transform into beams supporting an outer space-like hood. The visuals then became tunnel-like, featuring white, blue, green, and yellow colors from the lava lamp. During this experience, the participant communicated their observations to their partner while remaining coherent. As the effects wore off, they felt sleepy and in awe.

Both experiences were followed by aftereffects including sleepiness and a sense of wonder lasting up to two days."
834,47015,"The participant began their experience in a friend's bedroom, where they smoked an unknown substance from a homemade water bong. Initially, they felt slightly distorted but still aware of reality. As the effects intensified, they noticed that their vision seemed to lag behind when moving their head and experienced a feeling of reality slipping.

During this period, the participant attempted to communicate with two friends present as 'sitters.' However, each time they spoke, the friends laughed and exchanged glances, leading the participant to feel confused. They perceived themselves trapped in a repetitive loop where speaking certain phrases would trigger laughter from their friends, completing the cycle.

The participant reported seeing visual patterns forming what they described as the reality of life, feeling unable to break free from these loops. At one point, they stopped speaking, hoping this would halt the cycle, but it continued in a different form. They then became aware of an entity within a computer monitor playing anime, which spoke fluent English despite being originally Japanese.

The participant tried to warn their friend not to turn off the monitor, fearing loss of connection to reality. The entity inside the monitor warned the participant about something and communicated that they were the only link to reality for the participant. After some time, the participant regained the ability to communicate normally with one of the friends but remained aware of the ongoing loops.

The experience lasted approximately 6-7 minutes, during which everything felt as real as sober reality."
835,41719,"The participant and their friend K conducted an experiment in a dark setting near a campfire at night. K went first, inhaling a small amount of substance through a glass pipe and lying down. After about 30 seconds, he exhaled and remained still for some time before getting up and walking around with flailing arms, believing he was floating.

The participant then took their turn, inhaling a similar dose and lying in the same spot. They experienced visual patterns and swirls forming behind closed eyes, which eventually turned into a spinning portal leading to another universe. In this alternate reality, they found themselves behind a mountain wall where everything appeared blue and endless. The participant felt as if they were glitching through structures, first being partially inside and outside the wall simultaneously, then fully in the real world.

Upon returning to baseline, the participant noticed a blue forcefield emanating from their hat for several minutes before it disappeared. They attempted to find an entrance back into the wall by moving rocks around, still influenced by the experience. After coming down, they discussed the trip with K but found it difficult to speak coherently about what had happened."
836,46486,"The participant initially tried a substance but did not feel significant effects until a later attempt. On this occasion, they smoked salvia multiple times over several minutes. During the first session, they experienced intense physical sensations and visual hallucinations, including seeing a circus arriving through their back door before realizing it was part of the trip. The experience lasted about 8 minutes with residual body intoxication.

In subsequent sessions, the participant reported mind clarity similar to opiate effects and visual distortions such as walls moving closer and further away. They also encountered ambient white lights that communicated welcoming messages and encouraged them to invite friends into the ""salvia world."" These entities were initially perceived with fear but later amused the participant. The experience lasted about 10 minutes, after which they returned to baseline.

The trip occurred in a dark room, enhancing visual hallucinations. The user noted difficulty sleeping afterward, attributing it partly to the effects of the substance."
837,63469,"The individual began by taking two dropperfuls of a tincture under their tongue but did not feel any effects. They then smoked approximately 1/5 gram of extract from a pipe. As they inhaled, they felt their body remain stationary while their vision and mind pulled back, creating a darkened visual field.

During the experience, the participant saw thousands of copies of themselves trailing behind them as they spiraled upwards like a helix. These copies were depicted as Vitruvian man figures connected at hands and feet with bright orange and yellow light emanating from the points where they met. The individual heard a high-pitched chanting that repeated phrases such as ""You must [something]/Stay and play.""

After reaching a peak, the participant spiraled back down, absorbing the copies of themselves one by one until returning to their physical body. Upon regaining some baseline awareness, there was an overwhelming urge to clean up the area despite feeling unsteady.

While cleaning, the individual experienced a shift where their mind separated from their body and floated beside it. During this state, they communicated mentally with what seemed like a woman while their body continued its actions audibly in their voice. After finishing the cleanup, there was an instantaneous reabsorption of the mind back into the physical body.

The entire experience lasted approximately six to seven minutes but felt much longer."
838,45921,"The participant began their experience by consuming a substance in a small studio apartment with two others. They initially felt an uncomfortable vibrating sensation but managed to hold the smoke for about 20-30 seconds before experiencing a more intense effect. The participant then lay on the floor and saw a circular pattern, described as maroon with a sliver of silvery white, spinning counter-clockwise in what seemed like a pool of water. This image was perceived as ancient and unique.

The participant felt that this entity communicated through the bassline of a song by Massive Attack, conveying an urgent message. The sister interrupted this communication, causing some distress to the participant but also relief due to her presence. Afterward, the participant attempted to describe their experience to the others present but struggled with speech and movement.

The participant experienced altered perceptions of time and space, along with impaired motor skills and a reduced sense of balance. They felt hot and itchy, similar to the effects of a super-dose of Niacin according to one of the participants."
839,45653,"The participant reports smoking a substance from a small waterpipe in a quiet room. After inhaling deeply, they experience rapid onset effects that begin with closed-eye visuals becoming increasingly vivid and complex. The user feels their mind being gently pulled out of their skull into what is described as a fairy-tale world.

Opening the eyes reveals intense open-eye phenomena that are difficult to describe but seem to involve an additional sense beyond sight, allowing for the perception of magical beings in great detail. Closing the eyes again intensifies these visuals and brings about cerebral overhauls where phenomena such as becoming another person or communicating with strange entities occur.

One entity described is a woman whose body consists of alternating red and white cylindrical segments, contorting her legs to spell out words. The user's method of communication with this entity is not specified but involves an intense sensory experience beyond the visual.

The effects last for 5-10 minutes after which the participant feels as though they are closing off a magical portal into their own unique world."
840,45641,"The participant began their experience by consuming a small amount of substance in a quiet setting at night. After inhaling the substance, they felt a body buzz and a sense of separation from reality. They saw an infinite number of realities represented as a large wheel revolving around them. The participant experienced layers of themselves falling away, describing it as walking through a waterfall that cleansed their core. A voice encouraged them to let go and not panic. As the effects wore off gently, they felt cold and shivered before returning to warmth. They noted no hangover or body load after the experience."
841,45700,"The participant began by inhaling a large dose of an extract through a waterpipe. Immediately afterwards, they experienced a strong sensation characterized by a feeling of being pulled backwards as if by cords around their chest and jaw. This gravity effect persisted even while lying down. The participant then perceived the windowsill moving in a spinning motion similar to dizziness after spinning. They felt as though they were part of an infinitely spinning image that had no up or down, with the impression that they formed two sides of the windowsill box: one vertical side (their arm) and the bottom side (body/legs). The participant also saw another version of themselves spinning alongside them.

The experience was frightening, and the individual attempted to ""peel"" themselves out of the image, which resulted in a tingling sensation. After standing up with difficulty, they drank some Mountain Dew, which helped alleviate the tingling and gravity feeling. They sat down again, still unsure if they could become part of the windowsill again. The participant eventually lay back down once these sensations subsided, laughing at their disorientation.

The experience lasted approximately 30 seconds to a minute before the individual felt they had ""peeled"" themselves out. Afterwards, there was a calming afterglow similar to cannabis."
842,57500,"The participant experienced an altered state of consciousness characterized by a profound sense of rebirth and disconnection from their previous reality. They felt as if they were a newborn baby entering this world for the first time, devoid of knowledge about themselves or others around them.

During the experience, the participant encountered several entities and environments:
1. A herd of flaming horses that gave them wings, allowing their soul to ride the winds of time.
2. A grandfather dressed in his Sunday best, holding hands with a child wearing a blue dress with long red hair, walking between trees on a sunny day.
3. Cliffs by the sea where they stumbled and fell endlessly onto rocks, breaking apart into pieces before floating up surrounded by friends described as angels.
4. Lying on the desert floor, feeling part of the ground while observing fractal patterns dancing colors of spoken light.
5. A face peering down at them, to which they asked ""Who are you?"" and ""Who am I?"", receiving answers that held no meaning in their current state.

The participant also experienced a merging of two realities, where what was once not real became real, and vice versa. They felt confusion as the Committee (a group or concept) had yet to form, with voices calling them home to a place they did not remember as theirs.

Overall, the experience included moments of intense visual and sensory stimuli, interactions with various entities, and profound reflections on the nature of reality, self-identity, and time."
843,33177,"The individual prepared their room by dimming the lights and playing music before using Salvia Divinorum alone for the first time. They smoked two bowls, holding each inhalation for 30 seconds. After the second hit, they lay down and experienced a strong introspective state where their body felt like it was melting into the carpet. The room's furniture appeared to be melting and shimmering, whispering to them to sink into the experience.

Closing their eyes enhanced the visuals, which included beautiful colors and patterns that seemed to be part of the music they were listening to. This effect lasted about five minutes before fading. They then smoked again with a slightly larger dose, immediately feeling like they melted onto the floor. The music became an integral part of their consciousness, making them feel eternal and connected to sound.

The individual experienced a significant loss of ego, feeling safe and as if the plant was teaching them. There were no interactions with specific entities mentioned beyond the furniture and music personifying in some way."
844,32470,"The participant began their experience by smoking a substance from a water bong in a dimly lit room. They held each inhalation for about 30 seconds to enhance absorption. Initially, they felt their head and joints become strange but not significantly affected. As the effects intensified, the computer screen appeared as if it had taken on a face-like quality.

The desk and chair began to sway back and forth, creating an illusion of movement across the room. The objects on the desk started morphing with the surface, taking on a sugary appearance dotted with colorful candies. This created both exhilaration and fear for the participant.

Speech became difficult, and when they did speak, their voice sounded harsh and loud. They expressed a desire to move beyond their current location but found themselves confined to the back-and-forth plane of movement. The room felt alive, and objects appeared as living entities.

The participant attempted to ground themselves by looking behind them and speaking to the substance, which briefly interrupted the high before returning. As the effects began to fade, they moved to another room for a cigarette, experiencing difficulty in walking due to extreme body heaviness. They saw themselves as brightly colored toys with swiveling arms.

Returning to their bedroom, they engaged in drawing and reading about the substance. The sketches seemed vibrant and alive. The high wore off quickly but left them feeling extremely relaxed. Throughout the experience, there was a sense of reverence towards the substance, almost personifying it as a female force deserving respect."
845,58061,"Four individuals participated in a shared experience involving an unknown plant extract. Mary and Sindy, who were less experienced with the substance, exhibited intense laughter and confusion after consuming smaller doses. Tom, Huck, and the narrator consumed larger portions simultaneously, leading to more profound effects.

The narrator describes feeling as though gravity was pulling them in multiple directions and experiencing a brief period of complete non-existence. Huck left the room during this time. The narrator felt the soda cans against their body and saw music as physical shapes in the air. They experienced fear and philosophical thoughts about death, God, infinity, and deja-vu.

Tom and the narrator met under the coffee table to discuss shared ideas, feeling connected and isolated from others. Sindy tried to join them but was told she could not participate due to their perception of her as an ""Agent"" pulling them back to reality. The narrator did not experience visual hallucinations but felt they were seeing with their mind rather than eyes.

Travis left the room early in his experience, finding it too intense. After coming down from the effects, Tom and the narrator took a walk around their old high school, discussing their profound experiences."
846,35078,"The participant had two intense experiences. During the first experience, they felt disoriented and confused about objects around them, including their bong. They perceived everything as chaotic and abstract, similar to looking through a kaleidoscope internally. The only thing that made sense was their girlfriend's face, which provided comfort.

In the second experience, conducted at night with music playing, the participant entered a circus-themed environment influenced by the music. Glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling created pockets of space where they could see themselves and their girlfriend. They felt as if gravity came from the stereo and experienced an intense smearing effect across the room. The song's intercom-like female voice made them feel like they were on a spaceship ride, which eventually slowed down, making the room seem more 'real' again.

The participant also mentioned forgetting about having a body during the second experience and feeling ""created"" when their girlfriend touched them."
847,64303,"The participant and their friend smoked Cuban cigars before consuming a substance in two separate sessions. In the first session, they consumed 5x of the substance. They felt slightly off baseline but did not enter an alternate reality as expected. The colors appeared brighter, and they experienced a pulling sensation. After about 30 minutes, they returned to baseline with mild headaches.

In the second session, using 60x of the substance, the participant experienced stronger effects. There was a strong gravity sensation, vivid ocean visuals, and tunnel-like visual hallucinations. They also saw dots moving around and had fragmented speech patterns. The trip lasted for about an hour before coming down."
848,62903,"The individual began their experience by sitting on an unstable bench near a lake. After inhaling the substance, they immediately blacked out for several minutes before regaining consciousness. Upon awakening, they perceived everything around them as lego pieces, including themselves and their environment. They felt trapped within this geometric reality, unable to distinguish between self and surroundings.

The participant encountered authoritative entities that communicated in an incomprehensible language, explaining that escape was impossible. These authorities were involved in constructing new patterns, which the individual later realized might have been their friends on the bench but was not understood at the time. The participant struggled to detach from the lego-like environment, eventually freeing themselves and running around screaming.

They then noticed a small city glowing in the moonlight, which they perceived as a threat and wanted to destroy. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a tree branch with orange-yellow foliage. As their awareness increased, the geometric shapes slowly faded into the real scenery.

The individual attempted to prevent a friend from inhaling the substance by grabbing him and trying to seize it. This led to them rolling down a hill and landing in a lake. Upon climbing back up, they sought revenge on their friend but were eventually freed from his grasp after pointing out swirling patterns around the moon.

The experience concluded with a return to reality, marked by minor hallucinations such as mistaking dog poop for a dead toad and experiencing a time distortion when conversing with another friend."
849,45580,"The participant and three friends smoked an unknown substance outdoors on a warm, humid day. Upon inhaling, the individual experienced increased body temperature and difficulty controlling their bodily functions, such as laughing uncontrollably and drooling. They did not report initial visual hallucinations but felt physically uncomfortable. After smoking again with more of the substance, both the participant and his friend began to laugh intensely and felt as if they were part of an invisible spinning wheel that could not be stopped. The participant became anxious and was told by a friend to go inside.

Inside, the AC provided some relief, but the participant continued to feel altered. They crawled on the floor, feeling everything was wrong and foreign. Attempting to make a sandwich proved extremely difficult due to their altered state. The group then moved downstairs where the participant lay on a bed while friends searched for items. The participant became angry and yelled at one friend to get a knife, which he did not remember doing later.

After coming down from the experience, the participant felt somewhat stoned but more comfortable with his surroundings. He experienced lingering feelings of depression that day but returned to normal the next morning."
850,63793,"The individual inhaled a high concentration of an unnamed substance through a pipe and immediately lost awareness of their surroundings. They felt a burning sensation cutting through their consciousness, leading them to what they perceived as another reality. This new place was vast, endless, and timeless, causing the participant to feel disoriented and unsure if they could return to their original state.

The experience included visual elements such as a gray, deep, rushing vastness that the individual struggled to surface from. They were simultaneously aware of their physical body in an armchair but felt disconnected from it. The participant laughed uncontrollably during parts of the trip and eventually re-entered their seated body after about 30 minutes.

Upon returning to normal consciousness, they reported feeling elated and convinced that they had experienced a different dimension. No other entities were encountered during this experience."
851,44575,"The individual prepared for their first experience in a quiet setting after a birthday celebration. They inhaled a small amount of extract through a pipe and immediately felt intense effects. Initially, they saw hundreds of traditional four-pane windows forming around an equal-sided triangle. Next, three hazmat-suited figures were performing an unclear action on another version of themselves, which the participant interpreted as metaphorical birthing into the world of the substance.

Physical sensations included warped arm movement and a bed transforming into a miniature gingerbread house with heart-shaped decorations and candy cane filigree. The environment then shifted to a surreal landscape featuring bizarre creatures and plants in vivid colors like red, purple, and an unnamed hue. This scene was set against a red sky with a sinister carnival below, including a swaying ferris wheel and a frightening forest.

The experience abruptly changed to a serene lake under a golden sky with white clouds, then ended suddenly as the participant returned to their bed feeling exhausted but with mild aftereffects similar to cannabis."
852,63319,"The participant took one large hit from a glass pipe containing a concentrated extract and held it for about thirty seconds before taking another smaller hit and holding that for another thirty seconds. Initially, they felt strange pressures on their body and abstract thoughts forming. The setting appeared to shift dramatically, with everything looking as if it were facing a setting sun, skin appearing reflective and red, and the air around everyone looking orange.

The participant's mind split into two entities: The Goddess, described as a distinctly feminine presence that allowed them to look at nature and people in a new way, and The Scientist, which articulated abstract thoughts. They felt warm and comfortable with an electric shock-like sensation. The lighting changed from twilight to fractal combinations of colors they had never seen before.

The participant realized they were on some kind of drug but still couldn't comprehend why or how. They saw their friend C both inside one of the rooms in their body and outside looking at them, which caused intense laughter. During this time, another friend was squirming around on the ground, believing it to be a vertical cliff.

As the effects started to diminish, the participant felt like they were on the cusp of something extraordinary but also began to feel confusion similar to that experienced after other psychedelic trips. They heard what sounded like The Goddess whispering ""goodbye"" into their ear and continued to experience mild tripping as the ground seemed to be breathing.

The trip ended with the participant feeling a desire to forget much of what had happened, possibly due to the logical part of their brain trying to protect itself from unfamiliar ways of thinking."
853,66367,"The participant began by administering a threshold dose of 400 mcgs, which produced mild psychedelic effects lasting about 15 minutes. For the experimental session, they inhaled 2.2 mg of the substance. Initially, they felt it was not as intense as expected but quickly entered an altered state characterized by absolute nothingness or void. The duration spent in this void is unclear, but exiting it caused significant discomfort and fear.

Upon returning to a form of reality, the participant encountered strange creatures that seemed connected to their past but were unlike anything they had seen before. They felt comfortable with these entities at first but then became afraid when realizing their disconnection from familiar life. This led to heightened dissociation and confusion about why they were in this abstract dimension.

Gradually, the participant returned to a more recognizable state of consciousness. With assistance from observers, they regained composure and began to understand what had happened during the experience."
854,62637,"The experience began when the individual inhaled from a pipe containing salvia leaves. Within 20 seconds, they felt physical discomfort as if their organs were being stretched and pulled in different directions, causing sweating and unease. The participant then experienced a profound sense of forgetting, losing awareness of who they were, where they were, and what was happening around them.

Visual distortions followed, with objects splitting into multiple versions before the individual's eyes. Chairs, friends, and other items in the room appeared to be changing and rearranging themselves rapidly. The participant felt both awe and panic as these changes occurred simultaneously with a sense of two realities clashing.

The individual attempted to resist the experience by shaking their head vigorously but found no relief. They tried to communicate with their friends but could not move their lips, resorting to thought communication instead. Panic set in when they realized that everything else was changing while their friends remained stable in the old reality. The participant made a desperate attempt to leave the room and sought refuge in another friend's bedroom.

In the safety of the room, the individual closed their eyes and focused on letting go, gradually regaining awareness of being on a drug. They returned outside after about 7-10 minutes, feeling awe and a newfound respect for the experience."
855,55861,"The experience began in a bedroom with five people using a hookah containing a psychoactive substance. The narrator felt intense physical sensations after inhaling from the hookah but the others remained unaffected. When a bong was used next, the narrator experienced falling down a blue-and-purple staircase while watching their favorite memories play out on stage. They then briefly perceived themselves as another person in the group (J) before J had a severe reaction.

J thrashed about violently, damaging furniture and injuring everyone present. He appeared terrified but also adoring, with his eyes rolled back. The others tried to calm him down by lying him on a bed where he continued to convulse and speak gibberish. After some time, J calmed down and apologized for the damage caused, though he had little memory of what happened.

The group cleaned up the mess and relocated to the kitchen before moving outside to let J walk around. The narrator felt nauseous throughout the experience due to the psychoactive substance's effects on their perception."
856,56421,"The participant first experienced the substance at a low dose while running errands, feeling relaxed and happy. At a higher dose, they felt disconnected from reality, seeing a two-dimensional abstraction of a fence and experiencing childhood memories trapped inside a marker drawing. They also perceived their dogs as sitting on her lap when she was actually in her living room.

In another high-dose experience with friends present, the participant had multiple hits. The first hit caused blurriness, spinning sensations, and pressure pushing to the left, making reality seem like shards of glass. The second hit made limbs feel angular and moving while watching a psychedelic video. During the third hit, the participant felt they could control their experience by communicating with the substance, resulting in pleasant visuals.

A friend who also tried the substance experienced the carpet curling up and closing in on him during his first hit, feeling panicky but having no recollection of walking around. In his second hit, he felt the room turning sideways and feared being sucked out of it. Another friend reported a milder experience, similar to ""the best weed ever."""
857,51745,"The participant had four separate experiences on the same day, each with distinct effects. In the first two sessions, they smoked the substance with friends using a bong. During these sessions, the participant experienced sensations such as an invisible force pulling in their head and clothes feeling itchy. They also reported uncontrollable laughter and visual distortions.

The third experience involved combining the substance with cannabis while walking to a park. The user saw abstract images on the concrete sidewalk and neon wavy lines on the fence boards.

In the final session, conducted alone in their room, the participant smoked the substance and experienced severe disorientation. They forgot where they were and what they had been doing, feeling as if they had woken up in a foreign country with no memory of prior events. The user's perception of gravity was altered, making it difficult to walk normally. They engaged in unusual behavior such as putting on and taking off their jacket, picking up the family cat, and laughing uncontrollably.

After approximately eight minutes, the participant returned to normal but retained a slight positive afterglow."
858,55226,"The participant had their first experience with an unnamed substance in July 2006 after researching it online. They started with a low dose of approximately 3.5 grains, which produced immediate effects characterized by a ""creaminess"" and closed-eye visuals (CEVs) that were gentle and pleasant, resembling speeded-up Northern lights. The CEVs moved in crisscross patterns and had an auditory element described as an androgynous voice with an inviting quality.

After the initial experience, they increased the dose to 5 grains for a second session, which produced similar but more intense effects. The visuals were more vertical this time, with dark, almost foreboding images on one side and trellis-like patterns on the other that pulsed calmly. The participant felt as though the ""space"" had its own benign agenda.

For their third attempt, they again increased the dose slightly, experiencing a similar pattern of effects but noted a certain disappointment in the essence of the experience, akin to being told the night was nearly over without accomplishing anything important. They concluded by stating that the substance is potent and offers a mystical experience within a short duration, making it an attractive option for those with limited time."
859,43662,"The participant began by smoking an unspecified substance from two large bowls using a bong. Initially, they experienced mild physical effects such as discoordination between upper and lower body movements, which were perceived as humorous. After sitting down and smoking one last bowl, the environment around them started to crystalize, with a sensation spreading through their body.

With the lights turned off, the participant's field of vision became a flat, black plane with two dim, blurry rectangles (windows). The consciousness was aware of this plane without understanding it as 'vision'. Rectangles began moving rapidly. Over time, the consciousness learned to control one rectangle by turning its head and then discovered a dark spot caused by a hand.

The ego emerged separately from the consciousness, initially wanting the dark spot to reappear. As they linked up, they realized the dark spot was their own hand. The consciousness, ego, and body eventually merged into 'me'. Concepts such as being in a room, having an ass on the floor, smoking Salvia, and recognizing the windows returned."
860,43650,"The participant sat in a car at night with one friend near a campfire. After smoking a large bowl of an unnamed substance, they experienced sudden physical pressure pushing them into their seat. They then found themselves sitting on a dark floor, unable to feel their body physically. In front of them was a line of identical versions of themselves stretching as far as the eye could see, with trees and other objects aligned similarly.

A female presence communicated telepathically, asking the participant to come with her. The participant felt tugs from the left side pulling them away but refused multiple times due to concern for their friends on the physical level. The woman assured that friendships were possible despite differences in understanding between people. After several attempts, the participant decided to stay.

They regained awareness of the car and surroundings, becoming anxious about a container of the substance they had promised to give to their friend. They apologized and slowly reengaged with reality over the next five minutes."
861,43638,"The individual reported entering an altered state of consciousness characterized by a perception that reality was experienced in only two dimensions: forward and backward. This sensation made them feel as if they were confined within a flat plane, similar to being inside a sheet of paper standing upright. During the trip, visual perceptions became distorted; objects appeared to be ""unzipping"" or unfolding from underneath each other, creating an illusion that movement was akin to traveling through the depths of a creature's intestines.

The participant experienced discomfort while in a car, feeling as if they were inside something's mouth and unable to extend their limbs due to perceived confinement. This led to a desire to close their eyes and lay down to cope with the overwhelming sensations. Upon returning home after the trip, the individual felt that the entire world outside of their body was part of a single creature, seeing the house as the insides of this entity's body.

The experience peaked within 10 minutes and lasted for about half an hour in total."
862,49099,"The participant smoked 5x extract of an unnamed substance using a water bong while under the influence of other substances including Xanax, marijuana, and crystal meth. They felt detached from reality and experienced a breakdown of their physical form, perceiving it as a process of death. An entity communicated telepathically with them, explaining that this was part of a natural cycle. The participant expressed regret over their life choices and a desire to return to Earth for the sake of someone they loved deeply. After returning to reality, the experience had a lasting impact on the user's behavior."
863,46088,"The participant began to feel drowsy after consuming an unknown substance. They then blacked out and found themselves detached from their body, feeling as if they were part of the walls in the room. Two entities appeared on either side but could not be seen due to the inability to move the head. The individual became terrified and tried to escape but realized they no longer had a physical form. After mustering willpower, they managed to regain control over their body just enough to stand up, causing their iPod to fall and break.

Upon standing, the participant experienced visual spinning between objects in the room, particularly focusing on a yellow bong and a bottle of mescal. The two entities continued to laugh throughout this experience. The individual remembered consuming 'salvia' and felt frustration towards an unseen helper who did not assist them. They eventually relaxed and removed a blindfold before concluding their trip."
864,47194,"The participant began feeling heavy and relaxed after smoking the substance. Closing their eyes produced visual effects similar to looking at bright lights, forming stairs in front of them. They then heard a repeated echo of ""tripping"" from one of their friends. 

Next, they felt as if sinking into another world, encountering a green cylinder that spun slowly like a carousel. A friend was present but did not speak clearly remembered. The participant walked through a dark forest and saw a teddy bear-like entity.

During the trip, the participant briefly opened their eyes with tunnel vision and attempted to communicate incoherently, describing it as if speaking with a bowling ball in their mouth. They then closed their eyes again for further tripping.

After the experience, they felt extremely comfortable and drowsy, though only about 5 minutes had passed according to friends. The participant experienced some dizziness and heaviness before feeling fine."
865,45608,"The user began their experience by smoking a small amount of the substance in a park with a friend but did not feel any significant effects. Later that day, they smoked more of it at home while listening to music. Initially, there were no noticeable effects, but after about 10 minutes, the user felt as though the music was dictating their life and actions. They then left the room briefly, which seemed to reduce the intensity of the experience.

Returning to smoking, the user experienced altered perceptions of time and difficulty in pinpointing exactly what was different about their state. The music continued to have a strong influence on them, with the sounds seeming more intense and trippy than usual. After about 45 minutes, they felt compelled to leave their room and drank a beer.

As the effects began to wear off after an hour, the user listened to rap music and noticed that their thoughts were deeper and more reflective. They found themselves thinking about everyday objects in new ways, such as viewing beer simply as 'that thing you drink' rather than an alcoholic beverage. The overall experience was described as a mild alteration of perception without significant visual changes.

The effects lasted for approximately three hours, during which the user experienced a burnout feeling with tiredness and red eyes. However, their mind felt rejuvenated and fresh despite the physical discomfort."
866,43066,"The participant had their first experience in a dimly lit garage with three friends using a homemade hookah. They smoked approximately two and a half bowls, after which they felt an unknown force pushing them out of reality into a parallel dimension. In this new environment, they perceived themselves floating away from their physical body accompanied by what they conceived as a female entity.

Upon reaching the destination, the participant saw their friends in a completely white plane of existence, but not as humans; one appeared as a radiant aura, another like a mythological wizard. They received insights into how everything fits into the universe's big picture and felt communication on an entirely different level without spoken words.

In a subsequent experience with a stronger dose, the participant had a more intense and terrifying trip lasting about five minutes but affecting them physically for two hours afterward. During this time, they engaged in frantic movements, screaming incomprehensibly, and eventually collapsing. Despite these physical actions, the participant retained almost perfect recollection of their experience."
867,63924,"The participant smoked Salvia and Cannabis with two friends. During the trip, they experienced visual hallucinations while playing Guitar Hero, seeing colorful patterns resembling a Maian ziggurat. They believed these patterns were giving them signs related to their life-force and that their survival depended on focusing on the game's rhythm.

The participant had delusions about their friends being gods or angels, specifically identifying one as Azathoth. They felt they might be killed for their sins but were resigned to this fate. The participant also thought they were in a hospital and asked if one of their friends was a doctor, which he confirmed.

After the trip, the participant had strange dreams involving death, funerals, and tornadoes. A poem was written after the experience, describing encounters with entities and symbolic imagery related to the drug-induced visions."
868,55723,"The individual began experiencing a brightening room after taking an initial dose. They felt as though they were in space, questioning their connection to their body and the nature of reality. Upon taking another hit, the participant perceived themselves as part of the floor and imagined AC as a plant that could communicate with them. The music was interpreted as an ancient language conveying wisdom about life and happiness. Reality gradually returned, leaving the individual dazed for several minutes afterward."
869,48522,"The participant began their experience by consuming an unknown substance at around 10:30 PM. They felt a mild buzz and increased confidence, but no significant physical effects were noted. At midnight, they smoked marijuana, which added to their existing high. The participant experienced warmth and childlike playfulness while sliding on icy roads.

Around 1 AM, after their parents returned home, the participant engaged in conversation with them, feeling empathetic despite a previous argument. By 3 AM, the effects of the initial substance were still present, but the participant felt more social and talkative. They smoked marijuana again and then consumed salvia at around 4 AM.

The salvia trip began intensely after several hits. The participant saw themselves from an external perspective and experienced detailed visual hallucinations. Tiny hands appeared in various places, moving rapidly, which caused a sense of panic. As the trip progressed, these hands turned into children who seemed to be reactivating the participant's brain by filling it with creativity.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling 'weird' but without visuals or unusual mindset after opening their eyes and going to bed. They experienced residual effects while sleeping, including visualizations of children interacting within their mind."
870,41938,"The narrator began by smoking a small amount of extract and immediately noticed vivid trails as objects moved. He felt his consciousness dissolve, experiencing an eternity-like state where childhood memories replicated endlessly in front of him. This was followed by the perception of being trapped behind multiple portals leading to replicas of the room, with each portal containing another replica. The narrator tried to escape but felt held back.

As he started coming back to reality, the narrator noticed his friends and surroundings looked normal again. However, Nate, who had also smoked Salvia, began acting erratically. He became scared, stood up, and attempted to leave despite the narrator's attempts to block him. Nate clawed at his face and mouth, spat on the narrator's foot, and tore off his shirt before putting it back on inside out and backwards. The narrator helped Nate lie down, and he gradually returned to normal.

Brandon, who had been helping calm Nate, then smoked Salvia himself. He became disoriented and scared, reaching for the narrator's hand for support. After a while, Brandon recovered but did not want to talk about his experience. Later, when more comfortable, he described feeling part of the couch and seeing half of each brother's face as curtains on the wall.

The narrator later smoked again with another friend and experienced being part of a picture that ripped apart whenever he moved. He also perceived everything in the world as made of cigarettes, including walls and people."
871,37871,"The participant had their first experience with an unnamed substance, sharing it with four others. The initial hit caused only a slight alteration in perception without intense visuals or physical sensations. A second hit brought on a rush of energy and vivid visual effects, including colorful worm-like patterns that moved from the carpet to the bed. There was also a strong pull sensation in the legs during this experience. As the peak subsided, the participant's visual perception remained altered, with objects appearing differently than they actually were.

The third hit at home resulted in a more prolonged and intense experience. The participant felt as if everything around them had become a puzzle with pieces falling off, accompanied by vivid colors. This made it difficult to move or communicate effectively. During this trip, the participant's body also experienced sensations of being pulled apart, though not painful but rather amazing.

After both experiences, the participant felt extremely tired and relaxed, with no desire for other substances that night."
872,41618,"The participant smoked a 20x salvia extract with his friend in a car after attending a concert. Upon inhaling the smoke, he began laughing uncontrollably for about a minute before experiencing visual distortions where everything appeared to be made of blocks (lego-like vision). After approximately one minute, his vision faded to black and then transformed into a red line that turned over to reveal a large plate of shrimp. This unexpected image caused him terror and confusion. The experience lasted around five or six minutes according to the friend's account. During this time, the participant exhibited behaviors such as laughing, screaming, curling up in a ball, and mumbling to himself."
873,40903,"The participant experienced altered perception after inhaling a small amount of substance from a bong. Their field of vision changed, appearing as if they were looking through the surface of a giant soap bubble encompassing the entire room. The room began to gently rock up and down and side to side like a bobble head doll.

They noticed bright colored lines in the air between the corner of the ceiling and opposite wall down to the corner of the wall behind and the floor, each line separated by different shades of orange or yellow. These lines appeared as if they were two colors at once, with the first line red, second line orange, and so on.

A large dark green ghostlike form swooped around the room and flew straight into their eyes, shrinking in size until it was small enough to fly directly into their pupils. The participant laughed hysterically throughout this experience and became angry when their roommate spoke to them.

After about two minutes, the intensity lessened, and the participant felt slightly dizzy and lightheaded for another 15-20 minutes."
874,40612,"The participant began the experience in a relaxed state after spending Valentine's Day with their significant other. They smoked an extract of an unnamed substance, which immediately caused visual distortions and a sense of distance from reality. Black lines pushed the room away, black vines spoke in bursts, and the participant felt pressure on either side of their head. After exhaling, these negative feelings disappeared.

The Jimi Hendrix poster became an eye, the air vent another eye, and the door became a mouth, with the participant feeling as if they had become part of the room. They then experienced blackness and repeated ""What?"" and ""Oh!"" before returning to their room. The effects faded after about four minutes, leaving them slightly off-balance but mentally precise.

The participant called their girlfriend, noting that it was hot in the room, and took a shower to cool down. Afterward, they reflected on the experience and decided to try again with a smaller dose. This time, under blacklight and TV light, they experienced vibrant colors stretching across their surroundings and felt as if they had died and were searching for their life among thousands of others.

They found themselves in various memories and environments, including elementary school, a NASCAR race track, an orange abyss, inside the lava lamp, and back in their room. The room kept flipping like pages of an animation, each flap representing a memory or environment. They had to claw their way back into reality before being lost in one of these previous lives.

Reality returned with minor distortions for a few minutes, such as lamps growing and shrinking and sheets rotating without movement. The participant felt the aftereffects of the substance strongly but was able to regain control of their thoughts."
875,43952,"The narrator and their friend K smoked an unspecified substance together twice. During the first session, they experienced mild effects characterized by laughter and visual distortions. After sitting down to smoke again with a larger dose, the narrator felt dizzy and giggly after inhaling. They leaned on the window sill and then sat back down, still laughing.

The experience intensified rapidly for the narrator, who became part of a massive spherical vortex, feeling disoriented and spinning violently. The narrator perceived another presence (likely K) but was unaware of their surroundings. Paranoia set in briefly before the narrator remembered smoking the substance. They experienced fragmented thoughts about being inside their own head, seeing pieces of their face fall to the ground, and imagining themselves as slabs that refused to stay intact.

The environment shifted again, with the narrator feeling they were everything and existence itself. This was followed by a sensation of being zipped up from genitals to face, which became uncomfortable but not painful. The narrator managed to free themselves and felt calm and tranquilized, half-submerged in the carpet while looking at K from a baby's perspective.

K helped snap the narrator back to reality somewhat by pointing out that the TV was still on (showing Killer Klowns From Outer Space). The narrator tried to turn off the TV but had difficulty moving. Meanwhile, K performed an unusual jump over a box and later held the bong, accidentally spilling water on the bed.

As they came down from the experience, both individuals discussed their trip while walking to K's house. The narrator felt calm and reflective, while K was more animated and talkative."
876,38429,"A 24-year-old graduate student tried Salvia for the first time alone in his room. He prepared by turning off lights, lighting a candle, and playing calming music. The experience was divided into three stages: initial effects, peak, and descent.

At T+45 seconds after inhaling a small dose, he felt a buzzing sensation in his arms and legs, with green tracers shooting from black focal points when blinking. His body felt warm, heavy, and rhythmic, compelling him to close his eyes and breathe steadily. He could still identify objects in the room but was slightly sweaty.

At T+6 minutes, he sat up feeling extremely concentrated on a pen, writing spontaneously despite darkness. At T+10 minutes, he reached peak intensity where conversation would have been difficult and standing or walking nearly impossible without assistance. By T+20 minutes, effects were receding, allowing him to start noting down observations for the report.

Post-trip, he felt quiet, internally focused, happy, warm, slow, dizzy, and comfortable. He concluded that Salvia was not a social psychoactive and would not allow for standing in front of crowds or driving due to its effects on concentration and coordination."
877,32552,"The participant and their wife consumed an unnamed substance in separate sessions. The first session involved chewing two dried leaves for ten minutes and smoking three crushed leaves in a bong while reclining on the couch with eyes open. They listened to music ('The Girl from Ipanema') during this time. The participant experienced visual sensations of swirling peacock feathers forming a vortex below their feet, which seemed to be dancing to the music. They felt a strong rotating tug towards the left and had the sensation that people were watching them from off to the left. These effects lasted for about three minutes before subsiding.

In the second session, the wife chewed leaves for ten minutes and lay back on the couch with her head in the opposite direction of the first participant. She smoked three crushed leaves while listening to the same music but had her eyes closed. She reported feeling a force pulling her right arm towards the right, as if a big machine was grinding beside her. Her visual imagery included cheesy Florida pink flamingo 50s hotel-type scenes and she felt like she had become a twisting vine at one point.

Both participants experienced mild aftereffects similar to marijuana for about fifteen minutes before feeling normal again."
878,30596,"The individual participated in an experience with a psychedelic substance under the guidance of a friend named Michael. After inhaling the substance, they experienced intense visual hallucinations characterized by swirling day-glo colors against a black background, which seemed to form into a spiraling tornado. The walls and floor appeared to melt and reform into liquid-like waves that poured into the vortex on the floor.

The participant felt as though the world was ending and their molecules were being redeployed in someone else's grand plan. They believed they might be dying or had been killed, and thought about their wallet and family. Michael held them down and reassured them, telling them to relax and go with the experience.

During this time, the participant perceived Michael as either an angel of death or a spirit guide leading them to another realm. When coming back from the experience, they were unaware that what had happened was not real but a hallucination until Michael explained their behavior during the trip."
879,30546,"At around 10 AM, the participant prepared an extract and smoked it, leading to a sudden and intense experience. They felt themselves being dragged by powerful beings into a vehicle and transported to another dimension. Upon arrival, they found themselves in a vast plane with a large table and several massive entities who appeared to be their cosmic family. The participant perceived themselves as one of these beings, losing any previous sense of identity.

In the corner of this new environment, all human beings encountered by the participant were present, perfectly detailed but small enough to be held in the hand. They were scolded for meddling in human affairs and returned to a familiar yet altered reality. The experience concluded with intense visual disturbances and a persistent feeling of unreality, prompting frantic actions to regain a sense of normalcy."
880,30101,"The participant had their first experience with an unnamed substance after preparing the crushed leaves in a small pipe. They took several hits, gradually increasing the dosage. After inhaling deeply from the final hit, they closed their eyes and saw strange, small creatures composed of beating tentacle-like appendages that seemed to crawl perpetually across everything in the room while maintaining basic object forms. Accompanying this visual experience was a loud metallic buzzing noise and a sensation of being thumped by small objects all over their body. The participant felt as though these entities were carrying them backward, but they remained conscious enough not to be frightened. When opening their eyes again, reality returned quickly, and the room appeared normal."
881,37121,"The individual begins their experience by ingesting a substance at 9:30 pm on a Friday night while alone in their apartment. Initially, they feel catatonic for about 45 seconds before regaining control of their senses. They notice visual stimuli resembling red, green, and yellow lights moving like ants over an underlying structure, similar to the Matrix code but with spheres and worms instead of characters.

The participant feels a separation from their physical body while remaining aware of their surroundings. There is a sensation that if they lie flat with a straight spine, they could further separate their consciousness from their body. As the effects wear off, there's an awareness of being connected to sensory perception devices through imagined bands, similar to an octopus pulling its arms away.

The experience lasts approximately 12 minutes before the individual regains full control and gets up at 9:42 pm. They feel clear-headed and write a report about their experience."
882,31983,"The participant began by inhaling an unspecified substance using a pipe. Almost immediately after inhalation, they experienced a rapid onset of intense effects. They felt as though their existence was being erased from their fingertips upwards and described a sensation of being torn apart backwards internally. 

During the experience, time seemed to speed up, and the participant saw their entire life flash before their eyes followed by a big bang event. The trip then shifted to what appeared to be pre-birth times where God was constructing their soul. Another entity resembling Satan may have been present.

The experience continued with the participant in an apocalyptic scenario, witnessing orange-glowing figures running from a black liquid mass with tentacles that were snatching people and pulling them into the earth. A female voice laughed menacingly, saying ""You can run, you can't get away.""

Feeling fear, the participant tried to escape but was caught by the black mass. They then found themselves in a small dark box, cold and wet, with kerosene-like air. The same evil female voice taunted them, stating they would never be free.

After this, the participant heard their mother's voice urging them to get up and run into the darkness. A brown light appeared, followed by a flash of being four years old running to their mother's bedroom for comfort. They then returned to reality with a headache and many thoughts."
883,33980,"The experience began in a small basement room with dim moonlight and soft lighting. After consuming an unknown substance, the participant felt pressure inside their head and saw a hole hanging over the coffee table. They decided to approach it but experienced intense sensations as they did so, including feeling their mind being pulled out of their body.

In the next phase, the participant found themselves in a white room where they encountered a genderless entity made of smoke. The entity informed them that they were not done yet and asked if they were ready. After consuming more of the substance, the participant fell through various alternate universes with increasing differences from our own reality.

The gatekeeper appeared again, explaining that this space was called Blankspace and that time is unmeasurable. They also mentioned that walls separating universes are destroyed on the substance, allowing travel between them. The gatekeeper then revealed several concepts about the nature of existence and warned the participant to hide from a powerful female entity known as ""the Lady.""

The participant created a room for themselves but lost their sense of self when it was destroyed. They felt a flood of warmth and love as the Lady descended, speaking with the gatekeeper. The gatekeeper advised against revealing the participant to the Lady.

After returning to reality, the participant called a friend and discussed their experience."
884,29707,"The participant consumed an extract of an unnamed substance in a friend's house after drinking alcohol. They experienced vivid hallucinations where they found themselves between two glass-like sheets, unable to move except when bursting through one sheet into another identical space. A womanly presence communicated with them through pins on their forehead, sharing something extremely humorous that caused intense laughter. This cycle of being contained and breaking free repeated until the participant returned to reality in their friend's house, where they were found sitting still and giggling quietly."
885,40256,"In the first experience, the participant smoked the substance at noon in a dimly lit room. After inhaling, they lost all sense of self, location, and reality within moments. The sensation was described as pins and needles across the body, with space appearing to fold. Intense anxiety and panic set in as the mind struggled to comprehend the altered state. The participant thought about their family but did not recognize themselves. They moved towards a bathroom door, which seemed like a portal, before gradually regaining awareness after five minutes.

In the second experience, conducted at 10pm in complete darkness, the participant meditated beforehand and took a larger hit. This time, they felt as though they were part of something vast and ancient, planted in the ground with others around an old oak tree. The panic was less intense but still present as their mind resisted the altered consciousness. They briefly saw through a veil to recognize their computer before the experience ended."
886,60995,"The participant describes three experiences with an unnamed substance. In the first experience, after inhaling the substance, the individual felt nothing initially but then experienced being pulled into a white area where they could see blue thoughts and fly through their own mind. They encountered a robot-devil who directed them to different rooms containing memories of their past. The participant also saw a mysterious old black woman who flew them out of the tent.

In the second experience, after inhaling the substance again, the individual saw multicolored lines that turned into a coal mine-like area where they went through stages of grief. They felt as if they were grieving for the death of their own ego and eventually broke through the final wall to return to reality.

The third experience was described as the most profound. The participant saw a large mysterious circle on a grass hill, with everyone connected to it. The center represented something like an end or god, which scared them. They then found themselves in a warehouse with many worker-like entities and felt disconnected from their surroundings. The participant's friend Josh appeared as numerous faces bestowed upon the workers, and there was a void between his nose and upper lip where a worker was absent. The participant was pulled back to reality by their neighbor pulling into the driveway."
887,27315,"The participant experienced a strong force pushing them to lie down after inhaling the substance. They felt disoriented with rapid spinning sensations and lost sense of time and space. Voices from friends were heard but seemed slow and garbled. A recurring thought was perceived as being spoken in their ear: ""This is the path, don't despair, you will go past the door soon, but not today."" Gradually regaining some senses, they sat up with arms still unresponsive and expressed amazement."
888,33774,"The participant experienced four occasions of substance use, each with a sitter present. On the first two trips, they smoked three big hits through a bong while listening to music. During the first trip, with eyes open, they saw the room as if through a kaleidoscope, everything spinning and refracted. They laughed and felt thrilled but were advised not to talk by their brother. The second trip involved closing their eyes and feeling pulled backward and rightward, experiencing childhood sensations and seeing a piece of shirt material transform into swirling colors and shapes.

The next two trips had similar effects but less intense. On the last occasion, they smoked three big hits in a quiet room without music. They visualized their life as an organic contracting tube from birth to age 35, culminating in an essence of existence that surprised them with feelings of pure good, love, and light."
889,30420,"The participant began their trip alone in a closet after taking a hit from a bong containing salvia leaf and extract. They experienced heightened physical sensations, including sweating and an exaggerated awareness of bodily functions. A responsible self (R) urged them to relocate for safety. The participant then felt as if they were no longer human but rather just a spirit.

In this altered state, the participant found themselves in what appeared to be a jungle with an Aztec village at its center. They encountered hundreds of villagers who seemed familiar and spoke to them simultaneously. An older British explorer named Mr. Hunns, dressed in period attire, acted as a guide through the experience. The participant also interacted with an older middle eastern woman who treated them with a mix of disappointment and sympathy.

The trip ended abruptly, and the participant realized they had no sense of how long it lasted. They felt that during the trip, they experienced everything from everyone's perspective simultaneously, feeling both omnipresent and connected to all entities encountered."
890,35395,"The participant experienced three separate trips under different circumstances. In the first trip, they felt as if they were falling and grabbing onto clothing to pull themselves up, with friends watching them in anticipation. During the second trip, visual hallucinations included giant hands that appeared behind a friend and shifted flooring resembling fireworks. The participant also found themselves inside what seemed like a refrigerator with other entities and experienced an inability to move, feeling like an ice cube. In the third trip, they felt as if they were being pulled towards a bathroom by a vortex-like force while lying on the floor."
891,41619,"The participant consumed an unspecified substance and experienced a profound shift in perception. They felt they were transitioning from one reality to another more authentic form of existence. During this experience, they saw themselves as part of a meteor breaking apart in space, with visual and auditory hallucinations including screams representing the dissolution of reality. The participant's wife was present as a sitter and comforted them by rubbing their hair and face, which the participant perceived as being guided by an entity associated with the substance. After about 10 minutes, the experience ended, and the participant felt glad that reality had not truly ended for them. They visited two friends afterward to share their experience and allowed one friend to try the substance, though it did not have the same intensity. The overall effect was a greater appreciation of reality and strengthened belief in God."
892,40161,"The individual initially had positive experiences with an unnamed substance in a group setting but felt self-conscious and embarrassed due to social dynamics. In subsequent solo sessions, they experienced increasingly vivid visual hallucinations involving fractal patterns on a computer screen that appeared to crack and reveal blackness. Entities emerged as paper doll-like figures that evolved into menacing plastic Mexican Fisher Price-type people with connected hands. These entities communicated in a crowd-like din, expressing hostility towards the user. The experience was intense and terrifying for the individual, leading them to conclude that such powerful substances should be approached with caution."
893,36042,"The user smoked a small amount of the substance to gauge its effects before consuming a larger dose. After inhaling the smoke from a large bowl, they experienced an intense rush that felt similar to another substance but took them to a different place. During this experience, the participant believed they were in the space between someone's leg and a yellow laquered loveseat, aware of a history there but wanting to leave.

The user reported excruciating pain throughout their body during the trip, described as a mix of dull and sharp sensations that lasted 5-10 minutes. They felt confused and frightened while trying to peel themselves out of this surreal environment in search of a touchstone - their other half, Sally (the girlfriend).

As they came back to reality, the user recognized small computer lights and shadows turning into objects. After calming down on the floor, they climbed into bed with Sally, whose presence helped bring them back around."
894,35212,"Two sisters used an unnamed substance together for the first time. During the initial session in a room with glass pipes, one sister experienced visual distortions while the other felt compelled to leave what she perceived as a video game-like state. In the second session on a hammock, the narrator laughed uncontrollably and reported seeing beings forming everything around them through their arms, bodies, and heads. These beings did not want the narrator to return to their world. The narrator experienced being half in and half out of this alternate reality.

In the final session outdoors, the sitter became distressed and confused, believing she was in trouble for something but could not remember what it was. She thought she had been in a car accident and questioned if the narrator was really her sister or who they were. Eventually, the sitter came down from the experience and agreed to go home.

Both sisters felt that the experience brought them closer together despite the amnesiac effects scaring the sitter."
895,32893,"The participant smoked a concentrated substance in their room under dim lighting conditions. They experienced sudden feelings of heaviness and anger towards their dog, which they put in its kennel. The individual then became irritated with objects in the room, feeling as if these items were obstructing movement even though no intention to move existed.

Subsequently, the participant entered a trance-like state where they perceived themselves in a large room like a gymnasium and heard a woman's voice over a loudspeaker giving forceful orders. The individual followed an order that felt like being physically led along an edge into another reality but woke up just outside their room by thinking ""I'm not playing this game anymore.""

After regaining control, the participant felt mentally cloudy and confused, wanting to write the word 'unpleasant' in the air with a finger. They decided to sleep for about 30 minutes before feeling refreshed.

The substance was given to the roommate who smoked it and reported being very high but did not experience significant effects beyond impaired motor skills when making a sandwich."
896,37769,"The setting was a friend's apartment at 5:00am after an all-night MDMA session. Four friends were present: John, JL, Dave, and the narrator. The narrator had brought salvia to try out. Dave volunteered to be first, taking a hit from a pipe filled with salvia extract. Initially, he did not feel any effects but after about 10 minutes, he began experiencing visual distortions such as splitting rooms and words appearing like movie credits scraping against his sides. He could only see JL's head poking out of a void.

After Dave came back to reality, the narrator took their turn with salvia. They experienced seeing cross-sections of everything around them, including inner workings of appliances and walls, rotating in a rolodex-like manner. The narrator felt as if they were stuck in this new reality but eventually returned to normal after about two minutes.

JL watched both trips closely without intervening. Dave was eager for another hit and took it again, reporting that chairs seemed to be coming out of him during his second trip. John decided not to try salvia after observing Dave's reactions."
897,26510,"The participant first tried an unnamed substance in a wooded area with friends. After inhaling it, they experienced disorientation, feeling as if their body was weighed down and others appeared like cardboard cutouts. They then attempted the substance again at home while listening to trance music. This time, they felt pulled towards the ground and had heightened sensitivity to touch and temperature changes. Objects around them seemed more intriguing and frozen in time.

In a later experience, the participant tried the substance outdoors with friends on a clear summer day. After inhaling it, they experienced a gravitational effect that made walking feel difficult. They perceived their friends as being further away than they actually were and felt disconnected from reality. The environment around them seemed to take on new meaning, connecting them deeply to nature.

The participant then entered what they described as an ""indescribable"" state of thought, feeling as if they had known this truth for a long time but had been blinded by daily life. This realization was both humorous and frightening due to the fear of forgetting it upon returning to normal consciousness.

As the effects intensified, the participant became increasingly disoriented and began speaking incoherently. They perceived their friends as being far away on the path and felt compelled to chase after them through what they imagined as a jungle. During this time, they sensed unseen entities around them, feeling both drawn towards and frightened by these presences.

The experience gradually faded, leaving the participant with a lingering sense of altered reality."
898,30438,"The participant was alone in their room when they smoked a large dose of a substance. After smoking, they experienced visual distortions where the room appeared two-dimensional and flew into the bowl they were holding. They then closed their eyes and relived childhood memories vividly, experiencing both pain and joy from these past experiences. Time seemed distorted during this period.

When opening their eyes after about 10 minutes, they felt renewed and decided to look at themselves in a mirror. Upon doing so, they focused solely on their eyes and perceived them as gateways to the soul, seeing an intricate complexity within themselves that suggested a vastness beyond the physical realm.

The experience lasted for approximately 10 minutes from start to finish, with profound effects on perception and introspection."
899,50669,"The experience started in a garage setting where the participant inhaled smoke from an unspecified substance. Initially, they felt nervous and experienced shaking hands before inhaling what was described as a significant amount of smoke. This led to visual distortions characterized by large, moving, colored tiles covering everything they looked at. The participant became disoriented and lost sense of direction frequently, often bumping into objects due to the psychedelic visuals.

The experience included periods where consciousness seemed to fade for brief moments before returning with the same intense visuals. The participant communicated sporadically with their friend, who was present throughout the trip. They expressed confusion about their surroundings and the intensity of the experience, which they found overwhelming compared to previous encounters with similar substances.

After some time, the participant moved to a bedroom where they continued to experience vivid psychedelic visuals but felt more integrated into reality due to the presence of their friend. The overall duration of the experience was not specified, but it included periods of intense visual and sensory distortions alongside moments of confusion and disorientation."
900,50357,"The participant smoked two cigarettes containing a small amount of enhanced leaf material. The effects began gradually while smoking and reached peak intensity around twenty minutes later. Visual distortions were noted, including space distortion, intensified colors, and morphing reflections in mirrors. Clouds appeared to stutter instead of move smoothly when observed. Physical sensations were subtle but present. Thoughts were clear and meditative. The experience lasted approximately an hour and a half before returning to baseline."
901,40934,"The individual experienced heightened sensitivity in their mouth after sublingually administering the substance. They reported feeling an external energy that flowed through them from right to left, synchronizing with electronic dance music. This energy became tangible and controlled voluntary muscle movements independently of the mind's control. The participant observed their arms dancing without conscious direction.

As the experience progressed, the individual closed their eyes and entered a dream-like state filled with vivid but fleeting visual images that they perceived as physically real. These visions were described as representing deep-rooted aspects of life rarely considered. After the effects subsided, the person felt tired but emotionally balanced."
902,53050,"The individual experienced a series of visual scenes while using an unspecified substance. Initially, they found themselves in a summer-like setting with people walking and bicycling, set against a backdrop of hills, trees, and pastel grass. The periphery of their vision began to ripple like waves, leading them into a vortex that slowly sank into the distance. As they floated backwards through this funnel, they observed it narrowing and terminating at the head of an old man with closed eyes. Additionally, there were several offshoots from this main funnel leading to other parallel realities."
903,23131,"The individual began their experience in a study room alone, feeling a tingly sensation that pulled up from their arms to their neck. This was accompanied by visual distortions where the environment seemed to curl and ripple around the edges, almost forming a tunnel effect. A woman with a Southern or Black American accent repeatedly asked whose choice was better among several options being offered.

The experience then shifted to memories of houses on a street from when they were a child in the 1960s, which morphed into earlier times, possibly the 1930s, involving family vacations. The participant worried about being discovered by their son upstairs and tried to hide evidence of the substance use.

The experience was characterized by a repetitive pattern where objects and thoughts seen or thought about before the trip were replicated in series. This led to a sense of unfinished thoughts trying to complete themselves. There was also concern that family members might interrupt, particularly the wife who had a habit of calling frequently.

The participant noted that the last things seen or thoughts prior to the experience influenced its initial visuals and themes."
904,21133,"The participant describes two drug experiences. In the first experience, they smoked a 7x form of the substance using a bong. After inhaling, they felt their body being pulled down onto the couch and perceived their friends as being sucked into the floor, though this was not a full hallucination but rather a mental vision under their control. The effects lasted for three to five minutes each time.

In the second experience, the participant smoked a 10x form of the substance with three friends using a large bong. They experienced a stronger effect, feeling disassociated from reality and seeing their friends' bodies blend into the couch pattern before being sucked into a vortex in the wall. The visuals were dream-like rather than colorful or moving objects. The participant felt heavy and weighed down physically but was able to communicate with friends during the trip. The experience lasted about thirty minutes, peaking at twenty minutes."
905,36352,"The participant prepared for their first experience by conducting research and informing their girlfriend about the plans. They smoked a small dose initially, followed by another small bowl after 10 minutes, which provided only slight effects. After half an hour, they darkened their office and smoked a larger dose while reclining in a chair.

Upon inhaling, they experienced a sudden onset of intense sensations leading to a state described as ""falling through myself"" and ending up in a new dimension. They felt confused and naked, strapped to the nose of a rocket, suggesting a sense of disorientation and detachment from their usual self-awareness. The participant believed they were briefly within another entity's consciousness, experiencing a history and story associated with that space.

Throughout this experience, the individual reported excruciating pain throughout their body, described as a mix of dull and sharp sensations, both pulsing and constant. They felt compelled to peel themselves out of this surreal environment in search of a familiar touchstone or ""other half.""

As they emerged from the intense state, they recognized small computer lights and shadows that gradually formed into objects. The participant leaned forward onto the floor, experiencing confusion and fear. Once the experience subsided, they sought comfort by lying next to their sleeping girlfriend.

The overall impression was one of a heavy, enlightening, yet challenging experience."
906,35986,"The participant describes two experiences with a substance referred to as ""Lady Salvia."" The first experience was less intense than expected, possibly due to using foliage rather than an extract. In the second experience, they used a 10x standardized extract of the substance and experienced severe physical and psychological reactions.

During the second experience, the participant felt their soul trying to escape their body while their body fought to keep it in place. They perceived the world as splitting into multiple slices and feared being trapped in different dimensions. This led to panic and screaming. The eyes lost muscular control and twitched vigorously, causing the perception of everything shaking.

The participant's friend, who was not smoking the substance, saw the eye movements and became scared, which increased the participant's fear. They experienced claustrophobia and tried to escape by scratching at the car door. After exiting the vehicle, they were paranoid about snipers in the bushes and hid under their car until the paranoia subsided.

The effects lasted approximately five minutes at their peak but were followed by ten more minutes of paranoia. The participant also noted a strange sweat after smoking the substance."
907,33633,"The participant took an unnamed substance three times. In the first instance, after inhaling 1/20th of a gram from a bong, they experienced a brief loss of consciousness followed by the sensation of being part of a spinning wheel on an old stone watermill. They perceived green-clad leprechaun-like creatures and saw two-dimensional patterns morphing into faces on the carpet. Music playing seemed profound.

In the second experience, the participant felt resistance against attempts to 'figure it all out' and experienced brief lapses where they were pulled in circles. In the third instance, after increasing the dosage slightly, they felt overwhelmed by a large wheel that was at least as tall as their room. They managed to escape for fresh air where they nearly began rolling about in the street."
908,22031,"The participant and three others smoked an unknown substance from a bong. After inhaling the smoke, the participant experienced immediate effects: their left side of the body disappeared, and they perceived everything as more three-dimensional and squishy. They felt a diagonal line through their vision, dividing it into two parts.

The participant became confused and panicked, feeling trapped in an unpleasant scenario with an evil presence watching them. They tried to grab onto someone's arm but found that everything was just out of reach. The kitchen seemed unfamiliar and alienating.

After some time, reality slowly returned, though still warped. The body felt hollow, two-dimensional, and heavy. The participant went outside, laughing uncontrollably without knowing why. Inside again, they tried to piece together the experience while others played video games.

The next day, a friend also experienced intense effects after smoking the substance: murmuring, grunting, falling around, and screaming in terror before calming down and being confused about what happened."
909,22030,"The narrator and two companions (A and L) consumed an unnamed substance using a makeshift water pipe. They experienced an intense but short-lived trip characterized by vivid hallucinations. Initially, they found themselves in a dark dimension where only they were glowing, with the fringes of reality appearing as spider webs of lightning.

During this altered state, the narrator had a delusion that he was an ice cream sundae and described seeing colorful sprinkles on his head that felt like inchworms tickling him. These sensations intensified until the sprinkles burrowed into his brain, causing uncontrollable laughter and physical reactions such as rolling around on the ground.

L reported seeing two serpents emerging from the narrator's head, curling around it together. A described various objects on the narrator's head but interpreted them as Tetris pieces.

After a few seconds, reality shifted back to their original room with a moment of silence before they began discussing their shared and individual experiences. They stayed up for another 15 minutes talking about their visions before going to bed, where they experienced vivid dreams."
910,37000,"The individual begins by chewing two grams of leaves for 30 minutes before consuming three hits of extract. As the effects set in, they lie down and attempt to meditate while experiencing altered realities. Initially, they feel as though they are part of their bed, with the bed appearing vertical rather than horizontal. This reality quickly shifts into another where their upper body and lower body exist in different dimensions simultaneously.

The participant notices that these realities shift rapidly but realizes they can choose which ones to inhabit or let pass. By becoming more resistant to accepting any particular reality, the transitions become faster and more intense. Eventually, they experience a sudden transition akin to passing through a ""trap door"" into another dimension. This feels like leaving their current world while their body continues functioning normally.

After some time, the individual decides to return to their original state. Upon opening their eyes, they feel refreshed as if returning from a vacation. They continue using Salvia and meditation together, finding that with practice, the experience becomes more controllable and can even be transcended completely."
911,23108,"The participant prepared three bong hits using an extract and consumed two. Following the second hit, they became oblivious to their surroundings and experienced intense visual hallucinations, including flames and a tall, narrow, rectangular figure that may have had a flaming face. They also felt transported back to their early childhood home.

Afterwards, the participant found themselves in the living room on the couch with vague memories of moving there from the study. They heard disjointed TV dialogue which caused slight paranoia about being discovered by family members. The participant then returned to the study and consumed the third hit, experiencing vivid imagery resembling an Impressionist painting and curling lines forming a tunnel.

The experience included laughter at the herb's ""joke"" of tricking them upstairs and a sense of terror mixed with deep emotions. Memories from early childhood surfaced, including a preverbal feeling of tenderness towards their father's presence in the 1960s. The participant felt an overwhelming gratitude for their father's care and merged this with their own identity as a parent.

The experience concluded quickly after dinner preparation, leaving the participant with heightened sensitivity to energy, thoughts, sensations, feelings, and metaphysical principles."
912,29286,"The individual begins by consuming a mixture of cannabis and salvia divinorum. Upon closing their eyes, they experience a 3D environment that distorts their perception of the real world when opened. An old lady entity is perceived as watching and making fun of them, playing with their mind through visual distortions.

After redosing, the effects intensify, causing a floating sensation and strange mental processes. The individual attempts to control the experience by sitting up and typing on a computer, but finds themselves unable to locate certain letters due to interference from an audience-like entity in their head. This leads to an ego loss moment where they become aware of all their subconscious thoughts.

Paranoia sets in as the individual believes their mind is being controlled and that life is a joke orchestrated by unseen forces. They decide to walk to a friend's house, behaving strangely in public and laughing loudly. Upon seeing police officers, they remove their phone battery, fearing arrest due to government tracking. The paranoia continues with every person on the street potentially having implications related to the conspiracy theories.

After about 30 minutes, the effects begin to taper off, and the paranoia subsides. The experience is described as intense and altering rational thinking abilities significantly."
913,35298,"The individual prepared for their experience by brushing their teeth with chili sauce to improve blood circulation. They then chewed a rehydrated ball of 10-12 dried leaves in a darkened room. Initially, there were no noticeable effects except for a faint rushing sound in the ears. The participant engaged in meditative breathing and rocking motions.

At around 16 minutes into the experience, they noticed purple shapes in their vision when opening their eyes slightly. A bright purple being appeared on the left side of their vision, gesturing with elongated arms and fingers. This being was female, as indicated by a large feminine eye. The being created various shapes and figures in the air, including squares, triangles, animals, and male figures.

The participant felt warm and comfortable throughout the experience. They were initially unimpressed by the simpler creations but became amazed when observing the more complex interactions between the two male figures fighting before being sucked away into an invisible triangle.

After about 23 minutes, the rushing sound in their ears ceased, and they briefly glanced at a clock, breaking the spell. The experience concluded with the participant back in a dark room, feeling unremarkable except for having spit and plant material in their mouth."
914,34546,"Three individuals, referred to as 'Rabbit', 'Guerrilla', and 'T-Davis', consumed an unknown substance while sitting at the top of a hill overlooking a city. T-Davis was the first to take the substance and experienced intense panic, feeling disconnected from reality and believing he might be dead or dying. He moved around in a dazed manner and dug into the ground for no apparent reason before gradually coming down.

Next, 'Guerrilla' took the substance and immediately burst out laughing before becoming silent and staring at the stars while lying on the ground. His experience was described as unlike any previous drug experiences he had encountered.

Finally, 'Rabbit' consumed the substance and felt a sudden onset of intense sensations, including tingling throughout his body and difficulty speaking or swallowing. He imagined himself in a hole or grave with dirt walls and saw stars moving in circular patterns close enough to touch. At one point, he briefly saw a young girl in a window before coming down.

After descending the hill, they noticed that nearby bushes appeared as if someone had painted them, creating an illusion similar to a cartoon scene within a real-world background."
915,27685,"The individual began by preparing for the experience in a quiet room through meditation. They smoked a small dose of leaves saturated with extract and lay back with their eyes closed. Over the next half hour, they smoked twice more. During this time, they perceived homes arranged in an arc, representing similar levels of affluence and material security. This perception was accompanied by feelings of desperation, fears, and insecurities associated with making a living.

The participant then felt a sense of imperfection and unworthiness within themselves, as if part of them was missing or there was a hole in their side. They became aware of 'spinning' consciousness and an entity just beyond it. The entity communicated that the individual was held down by ties representing family, society, and being 'good.' These ties were depicted as bonds connecting to the stem of a leaf, symbolizing the interconnectedness of humanity.

The experience concluded with comforting images of rural New England hills and fields from the participant's youth. They felt an afterglow without lingering negativity but took away lessons about striving to be less self-centered and more nurturing."
916,47094,"The participant reported experiencing vibrant, transforming colors and intricate geometric patterns that enveloped their vision. They felt a sense of merging with these patterns until they perceived themselves as part of an unfolding chrysanthemum-like structure. This led to what was described as an unimaginable ascent into another realm.

In this new environment, the scenery was overlaid by millions of tiny vibrating cubes, each producing distinct sounds upon vibration. Two male entities appeared, both wearing elaborate eyewear or goggles that conveyed their status as fashionable in their dimension. These entities engaged in a competition to impress the participant with increasingly complex and visually stunning displays projected into the sky.

The encounter ended when the participant felt overwhelmed by the beauty of these displays, at which point they were drawn back from this experience."
917,31827,"The individual prepared for their experience at a secluded campground, playing didgeridoo before consuming the substance. Initially, they felt afraid and depressed with a sense of eternal misery. After about five to ten minutes, this feeling subsided, allowing them to enjoy hallucinations. They became aware of other people around them, though these were not visual entities but rather an awareness of their presence. One entity was identified as their sober self. The individual also experienced a sensation of being pulled down into their chair and nearly falling out while attempting to leave their body. Later, they felt the urge to sleep or walk in the forest before remembering their plan to stay in a trance-like state by playing didgeridoo and meditating. This activity led them to an optimistic and happy mental state."
918,24642,"The participant consumed an extract substance with a friend in the back porch area. After taking a large hit, they experienced intense psychological effects characterized by a sensation of being split apart psychologically. The environment appeared to warp into geometric shapes, particularly resembling stairs, which created confusion and disorientation. They felt as if reality was defined by odd shapes that their psyche had to conform to.

The participant's vision became distorted, with objects appearing in a three-dimensional, perfectly angled indentation leading into what they described as a strange wound in the fabric of reality. This experience was accompanied by intense magnetic forces pulling them from various angles, causing fear of falling out of their chair due to directional pulls. They also experienced tactile sensations twice, in two different psychological representations.

As the effects began to subside, the participant noticed that their friend appeared as otherworldly beings, leading to a realization that normalcy is an illusion and we are all alien beings living in an esoteric universe. The experience was described as awe-inspiring but also terrifying, with the participant feeling shell-shocked upon returning to logical reality."
919,41373,"The participant began by feeling euphoric and energetic after consuming an initial substance, leading them to dance around their room. They then consumed another substance, experiencing a mild detachment from their body and visual distortions characterized by a red, shifting layer over everything they saw. Upon taking a second dose of the same substance, they were forcefully removed from their physical form and entered into what they described as an abstract, symbolic universe. This experience was marked by confusion, a sense of eternal time, and difficulty in maintaining stability or identity. The participant perceived environments through synesthetic labels derived from sounds and music playing at the time.

As the effects intensified, objects around them began to take on symbolic meanings, appearing as if selected from a computer monitor and changing colors. They experienced various stages of intensity before gradually returning to a semi-conscious state with dreamlike visuals even when their eyes were open. The entire experience lasted approximately 45 minutes but felt much longer due to distorted time perception."
920,19990,"The participant began by smoking an extract of an unnamed substance using a bong with a butane torch lighter in a quiet environment at midnight. Initially, they experienced no effects except for profuse sweating and heavy arms. After inhaling a larger dose, the individual reported losing all thoughts and having no memory of how they arrived at that situation.

Visual hallucinations followed: their hands appeared to transform into multiple hands extending into the distance. A female voice said ""hand,"" and a male voice said ""zoom."" The room became psychedelic, with voices attempting to pull the participant into an alternate reality described as being directly below where they were lying. The individual resisted, shouting that they did not want to go with them.

Inside their head, there was a conversation between different parts of consciousness discussing fear and potential loss of control. After resisting further, the participant managed to return to normal reality but still perceived the female entity near the radiator. To convince themselves of reality, they smelled a sock and shouted about its reality.

For approximately ten minutes after returning to normal reality, the individual felt extremely drunk and hazy, repeatedly stating ""that was so weird."" Physical discomforts included feeling warm and as if three people were sitting on their chest, though breathing was easier than usual."
921,19747,"The participant purchased an unknown substance from a head shop and conducted research before consuming it. They smoked the substance in three large inhalations with a sitter present. After the first two inhalations, they felt a pleasant electric sensation starting in their feet and legs that intensified as the effects set in. By the third hit, this sensation had spread throughout their body, causing intense vibrations and a feeling of increased gravity.

The participant experienced hallucinations where they perceived themselves becoming flat and legless, with their legs rolling up like window shades. They briefly considered standing but decided against it due to concerns about balance. The experience then shifted, making the participant feel as though they were melting into the loveseat, losing the distinction between self and surroundings.

After approximately 5-6 minutes, the participant returned to a more lucid state. They remained in this state for another 10-15 minutes before regaining full speech and balance capabilities. The experience was followed by a period of excitement and well-being that lasted into the evening."
922,46726,"The individual began by smoking an extract of an unnamed substance, experiencing immediate physical sensations such as hot prickles all over the skin and sweating. They lost motor control shortly after inhaling. As the experience progressed, they felt intense movement and inertia internally, accompanied by a sense of purification, joy, and acceptance.

Entities appeared in the room, including a Dryad that emerged from the dresser next to the bed. The Dryad communicated with the participant, expressing delight at being seen. Other entities gathered around, some intimate and others more distant. The experience had an erotic component, though the participant did not achieve physical arousal. The Dryad cuddled the participant and shared stories of her adventures as a tree turned into furniture.

As the experience began to fade, the entities withdrew respectfully, leaving the participant alone with the Dryad. After their interaction, the Dryad returned to the dresser, and the participant's awareness of her faded. The entire experience lasted just over one minute but left a lasting impression on the individual, who has not used the substance since."
923,20043,"The participant began their experience in a relaxed state after consuming a small dose of dried leaf material. They felt dizzy and sat down as their head started to spin. A warm, familiar feeling came over them, reminiscent of early childhood memories involving walks with their mother in Philadelphia. The surroundings seemed dreamlike yet real, and the participant became highly aware of sounds and smells.

The experience was described as peaceful and cosmic, with a sense that life felt 'right' from an observer's viewpoint. Objects appeared to smile at the participant. They stood up to open windows but felt like they were floating rather than walking. The overall sensation was enchanting and positive, leading them to hope for another similar experience in the future."
924,19329,"The participant had two sessions with an unnamed substance. During the first session, they smoked raw leaves and felt their arms become heavy. They saw streaks of colors behind closed eyes that melded with music. The user perceived a spirit communicating reassurance and eliminating anxiety. Small tugs were felt on the body, accompanied by visions of fairies flying above them, pulling at strings attached to various parts of the body in rhythm with the music.

In the second session, after consuming more of the substance, intricate designs resembling Native American art appeared on the user's skin as tiny colored beans rushed over their body. The user then felt as though they were in an ocean, seeing sunlight create a turquoise color and noticing green human-like entities swimming around them. These entities had seaweed-like hair and gestured for the user to follow them. The user emerged from a giant kelp-like plant, surrounded by others emerging similarly, symbolizing birth from this mother plant."
925,18977,"The individual was in a calm setting with their boyfriend on a Sunday morning when they decided to try a psychoactive substance for the first time. After taking one hit, they immediately felt the effects. The participant experienced visual hallucinations where everything around them seemed to disintegrate into nothingness. They saw walls peeling and melting faces of their boyfriend. Voices were heard telling them to let go of reality and join an unknown dimension. The individual fought these sensations by clinging onto physical objects and their partner, feeling terrified throughout the experience. After a short duration, the effects subsided, leaving the participant shaken but unharmed."
926,18848,"The participant prepared for their experience in a dorm room with dim lighting and music playing. They smoked a medium-sized bowl of an herbal extract and felt a slight change in perception immediately after the first hit, describing it as a 'fakeness' to everything around them. After two more hits, the effects intensified.

Visuals began to appear on a building across from their room, starting with a translucent outline of a human hand that transformed into thousands of hands cascading down the building. The participant then perceived these forms as basic matter or atoms, extending this vision to encompass all objects in both indoor and outdoor environments. They watched everything decompose into atoms falling rapidly downward.

The experience became distressing when the participant realized they would soon disintegrate into atoms themselves. Their body appeared to fall apart visually, and their point of view shifted to third person as they saw themselves merging with the atoms that now comprised the entire world. After this intense phase, there was a period without visuals but where everything in the room looked unfamiliar.

The experience ended abruptly when the music was turned off by the participant's girlfriend, who had been present as a sitter. She noted that the participant had spilled bong water and received a cut on their forehead during the trip. The participant felt they learned valuable insights about the interconnectedness of all matter from this experience."
927,42977,"The experience began after consuming the substance in a group setting outdoors. Initial effects included laughter and playful behavior as participants ran down a hill and engaged in games like foot-hack. The narrator then experienced visual distortions, focusing on details such as grass blades, dirt, and a black tape with mineral deposits around a building's base.

In the second phase, the narrator stood on what appeared to be black pavement overlooking a world with distinct societal levels: laborers on the pavement, middle-income people among tall grasses, secret society members in rocks and dirt, and elite individuals at the edge of the world. The narrator spoke about these groups in an authoritative tone before the effects began to fade.

For the third phase, the narrator consumed a larger dose alone with another friend. This led to intense visual hallucinations including a tunnel-like experience where they felt pushed through time or worlds. They found themselves in what seemed like a harbor setting with buildings that had faces resembling Pringles characters. The narrator interacted with these entities and experienced fear when questioned by an entity resembling the Pringles character.

The friend's voice helped bring the narrator back to reality, though the transition was accompanied by visual distortions of color splotches. Upon returning to normal perception, the narrator felt uncomfortable and wished for the experience to end quickly."
928,15862,"The participant met a shaman at a smoke circle who introduced them to a substance known for its intense effects. A close female friend experienced the substance first, feeling lightning come off the pipe as she took her hit. She emerged breathless, happy but frightened, unwilling to try it again. The participant and their brother then tried the substance together; they perceived a mosaic of energy tic-tacs in front of them. The brother heard voices shouting about microspheres while the participant felt awe, confusion, worry, and joy.

The next day, the shaman introduced the participant to a stronger dose of the substance outside a tent. Upon inhaling, the participant felt as if they were trapped in their mind, unable to wake up their body. They managed to send out a command for help, which was acknowledged by the guide. The experience then shifted into laughter and clapping, with a long word or 'love' being unzipped by entities. The participant perceived themselves as part of an ancient web of energy.

After returning to reality, the participant attended a peace celebration where they felt half-inside the substance again. They later tried it twice more in daylight, each time experiencing similar sensations of isolation and eventually connecting with their guide. During these experiences, they communicated slowly and calmly about the world around them. The participant left feeling amazed by the experience and its impact on their perception of reality."
929,18134,"The participant began their experience in a prepared environment with their wife present. After inhaling the substance twice, they reported feeling a slight pulsation over their body and seeing images outlined with fluorescent dots. As the effects intensified, the tassels on the blanket appeared to move like dancing legs, and multi-colored paisley patterns swam before them.

The participant felt heavy and experienced an intense prickly sensation all over their body. They found themselves in a hospital setting awaiting surgery, which was later identified as a past experience. Upon returning to the room, they perceived it as stadium-sized and were surrounded by their wife and three other beings. The wife reported that these entities appeared distant or non-existent from her perspective.

The participant expressed a desire for another hit and observed the surroundings warping and distorting. They encountered a wall made of stone blocks which instilled fear and an urge to return to reality. When attempting to look at their wife, they experienced visual distortions characterized by bright light areas and dark silvery colors.

After about 30 minutes, the effects began to fade, leaving the participant feeling more creative in the following days."
930,14766,"The participant experienced three intense episodes after ingesting an unspecified substance. During these episodes, they lay down in a darkened room with minimal light from a TV playing music. In the first episode, they saw tall green walls that seemed to wrap around them and felt cold, warm, clammy sensations. They perceived a comforting presence communicating ""Everything is fine, Relax."" The second episode involved seeing doors falling from the corners of their eyes and entering a space where patterns followed head movements. They made hand gestures as if reaching for something or making shapes with their hands. In the third episode, they saw a large entity with yellow and black humps moving towards them, which they later identified as resembling spider legs. This encounter caused some fear, prompting them to roll over onto their stomach and gasp for air. The participant felt safe and comforted throughout most of the experiences but was briefly scared by the appearance of the spider-like entity."
931,33090,"The user reported a significant change in their experience following a high dose of an unnamed substance compared to previous, lower-dose experiences. During this trip, they experienced vivid visual changes and mood elevation. Post-trip, they noticed persistent visual disturbances including movement in peripheral vision, bright colors, transparent blobs, and black splotches. These effects were exacerbated when focusing on bright objects or during subsequent use of the substance. The user felt a sense of altered consciousness and ongoing visual anomalies that persisted beyond the initial trip."
932,33950,"The participant inhaled a high concentration extract (40x) and immediately began to feel its effects. According to the sitter's observation, the participant touched themselves and the bedside table before sitting up and saying ""Unemployment strategy."" The participant then lay down, drooling profusely for several minutes before speaking again.

From the participant's perspective, they found themselves in a place with moving colors that felt alive. They were not in their body but rather just beyond these colors. A green box appeared briefly, shaking and morphing before disappearing. The colors began to move in an organized manner, as if part of a competition or race. This experience was immersive, affecting all senses.

The participant then perceived themselves moving through a tube covered in greyish saran wrap, with the colored patterns visible through it. As they moved forward, they entered total blackness and rushed towards two distant light sources, which were their eyes. The field of view gradually expanded as they approached these lights, eventually snapping back to reality.

The sitter noted that the participant had been unresponsive for about 8 minutes, during which time their eyes remained open. Upon returning to awareness, the participant expressed amazement at the experience and disbelief regarding its duration and their actions during the trip."
933,21027,"At 9:03 AM, the participant inhaled a small amount of substance through a pipe and began experiencing effects almost immediately. They felt an entity knocking and inviting them into what they perceived as ""the pattern,"" described as an infinite design or grand order. The participant resisted joining this pattern, feeling that their individuality did not fit within it. Despite this resistance, the entity continued to encourage them to join.

The participant communicated with the entity verbally but had doubts about whether the entity could understand their words. They felt a strong pull towards the pattern and took another hit of the substance, further engaging with the experience. The entity allowed the participant to return to their normal state when they expressed reluctance to fully integrate into the pattern.

After the experience, the participant wrote down their thoughts, feeling strange and uncertain about rejoining the world. They described a deep understanding of being connected to this grand design but also treasuring the chaos and randomness of their current reality. The entity was not physically present but communicated through what the participant perceived as a spiritual or metaphysical connection."
934,25258,"The participant experienced three distinct trips with an unnamed substance. During the first two trips, they reported brief periods of altered perception, including forgetting who their girlfriend was and imagining themselves as a table in a childhood home. Both experiences were described as funny, stimulating, and peaceful. The third trip occurred at a playground late at night with several friends present. After smoking the substance, the participant felt an unusual sense of physical strength and struck a Superman pose. They then had a philosophical insight comparing everyday life to Clark Kent and the altered state to Superman, feeling that this side was more powerful and meaningful. This insight persisted for over an hour after the effects began to wear off. The participant also noted a prolonged state of mental clarity that lasted even after waking up the next morning."
935,24376,"The individual experienced a state where they felt detached from reality, observing themselves from their own perspective while floating in an environment resembling an African jungle. They saw a waterfall with water flowing from the mouth of an ancient tribesman who was speaking in an unknown language, with letters pouring out of his mouth and descending into misty clouds. The participant then encountered three unfamiliar but familiar beings with long black dreadlocks, whom they tried to touch but were unable to reach. These entities eventually vanished before their eyes as the individual began returning to reality."
936,11646,"The participant began by consuming a substance in a homemade pipe, feeling the effects almost immediately after inhaling the smoke. They experienced a sensation of flying over water from an elevated perspective, observing perfect waves or ripples that were about 2-3 feet high. Throughout this experience, they felt the presence of what they believed to be their mother, though later speculated it might have been a female entity associated with the substance.

The participant also noted hearing background music as if through a long tunnel and had moments of self-reflection, including thoughts about their daughter and concerns about returning to reality. Despite these thoughts, they felt assured by the awareness that they were still breathing and decided to fully embrace the experience.

After approximately 10 minutes, the participant returned to their recliner, expressing excitement and amazement at what had just occurred. They described feeling dizzy but relaxed afterward, with a strong desire to explore this substance further in the future."
937,37809,"The participant experienced visual and auditory hallucinations upon ingesting a substance. During the experience, they encountered several entities: their 'salvia brothers', 'sisters', and 'mother'. The participants' interactions with these entities included speaking with them and expressing disappointment at having to leave. They also mentioned another instance of themselves saying different things, indicating a shift in mannerisms.

Afterwards, the participant returned to their normal state and expressed amazement. They then decided to play guitar but felt they were at an elementary stage and should focus on other areas like coding and web design. The experience led them to reflect on their life, recognizing that they had been lazy and needed to work harder towards goals such as earning money for college."
938,37763,"The participant smoked a high dose of Salvia divinorum (approximately 400 mg) outdoors in a residential area around noon. Initially, they experienced their legs transforming into vines and leaves, spreading up their entire body, making them feel like a human-shaped plant creature rather than themselves. They observed the trees with an enhanced, almost waxy three-dimensionality.

A mother and daughter approached on the sidewalk; however, due to the altered state, the participant perceived them as non-English speaking entities and instinctively retreated into their house for safety. Inside, they felt like a couch, contemplating what it was like to be immobile furniture without sensation or care.

The experience lasted about 10 minutes before the participant returned to normal consciousness, feeling glad not to have caused any harm. They noted visual effects such as ribbons of color moving around the room and lingering aftereffects but no significant ongoing experiences."
939,12004,"The individual began their experience by smoking marijuana and then using Salvia. The effects were intense, with every sound, light, and person around them contributing to the trip. Visuals included seeing a crowd as a solid mass moving in waves. They formed an imaginary tunnel-like structure and felt they could lift the night sky like a jigsaw piece. The individual believed they had control over the trip for the first time. They levitated slightly above the party site, perceiving it as the entire world. After about 30 minutes, the effects began to diminish but were still noticeable, allowing them to pass their hands through solid objects such as bags and legs. When moving from one part of the dance floor to another, they felt as if they had teleported without physically walking there. The next day, residual effects like melting into objects persisted."
940,10091,"The participant reported feeling an intense physical sensation of restraint, as if their body was being held against their will. This led to discomfort and a sense of alienation from their surroundings. They described a state of mind that was uncomfortable, awkward, and radically nihilistic, reminiscent of childhood experiences in unfamiliar environments. The user remained conscious but felt disconnected from reality. After a few minutes, the effects subsided, leaving them wondering about the purpose of the experience."
941,34869,"The individual smoked an extract and felt sensations in their legs before experiencing a powerful onset that left them disoriented and disconnected from their body. They fell backwards into some objects in the garage, which contributed to the sensation of falling and being hit on all sides. The participant was unable to remember basic aspects of reality and had a sense of having forgotten important information or rules governing it.

After reconnecting with their body, they experienced geometric patterns in clouds while lying on the grass. Over the next 20-30 minutes, they gradually regained memory of who they were and their life. The experience was described as intense, strange, and not particularly enjoyable but also amazing and potentially worth repeating under proper conditions."
942,8313,"The individual experienced a separation of consciousness from their physical form after using a psychoactive substance. They perceived a spinning hole in their visual field, which they entered to find themselves riding through a tunnel-like structure while still aware of their surroundings. Upon exiting the tunnel, they found themselves in an expansive alien landscape where two entities were present. These beings had a cartoon-like appearance and were laughing and pointing at the individual. Another entity with a glowing head communicated with the participant, advising them not to be afraid. The individual felt a strong sense of love towards this glowing-headed entity but lost contact when they diverted their attention away from it. They then re-entered the tunnel for another ride before returning to reality."
943,9215,"The participant prepared for the experience by soaking leaves in their mouth and setting up a room with minimal lighting. At around 15 minutes into the experience, they felt relaxed and found it amusing that communication was difficult due to the effects of the substance. By 30 minutes, slight uncoordination was noted, and while walking outside, they perceived a large black void momentarily falling on them. A power tool sound caused fear but did not affect their lucidity.

At 45 minutes, another dose was taken, leading to an intense freeze when looking at a candle flame. With eyes closed, the participant experienced a sensation of moving a huge ball of wool up their body. They then engaged in conversations with various entities and patterns they perceived, including talking to a tall candle flame referred to as ""Fire Lord"" and engaging with shapes in curtain patterns.

Around 1 hour into the experience, the participant entered a meditative state where they encountered evolving beings and asked them questions that led to self-realization. Paranoia about the beauty of candles and an urge to touch a red-hot stove element were noted. At 1.45 hours, the participant's speech became more incoherent and inappropriate.

The experience peaked around 30 minutes and lasted for approximately 2 hours. The participant felt intoxicated but not sick during this time. They left the setting after being asked by their friend to do so and drove home while still under the influence. After stopping for ice cream, the effects gradually faded over the next couple of hours."
944,9191,"The individual began their session with several bowls of marijuana and then consumed a large amount of non-standardized 5x Salvia in one inhalation. Immediately after consumption, they experienced confusion about their location and identity. This progressed to a complete loss of self-identity and perception, where life became an unfamiliar concept. The participant described breaking down into basic sensory states, becoming shades of color before reaching what felt like ground zero.

After this state, the individual gradually rebuilt their sense of self, experiencing layers returning until they regained full consciousness. They remained still for a long time after regaining awareness and eventually turned off the lights and music before going to bed, laughing as they slept."
945,8241,"The individual began their experience in a quiet room with low lighting and soft music. They started with a small dose of the substance under their tongue, held for five minutes before swallowing. After another five-minute wait, they noticed subtle changes in how the music sounded, describing it as more textured and prolonged. Visuals appeared as colorful waveforms oscillating along curves.

The individual then increased the dosage slightly by holding another mixture under their tongue for five minutes. Within two minutes of this dose, there were definite changes in perception. The music took on a resonant quality, with each note seeming to resonate smoothly around the room. Visuals included vivid colors and shapes that vanished when eyes were opened.

The individual then turned off the music and observed the room's decorations, which appeared more colorful and sharply defined. They heard a soft whooshing sound, initially imagining it as a friendly monster before realizing it was a jet passing overhead.

After another five-minute wait, they got up and went into another room where they listened to chimes with the same resonant quality. The experience lasted about 35 minutes in total. Afterward, the individual felt relaxed but took some time to fall asleep, experiencing vivid dreams during the night."
946,8995,"The individual began their experience by lying down and shutting their eyes, feeling a sense of detachment from reality. They perceived themselves floating above their body, which was described as being on the surface of reality, likened to water. Beneath this surface, there was a cavernous space where they engaged in internal dialogue.

Next, the participant became aware of their breathing causing their body to expand and contract, describing it as a pleasant physical sensation. Upon regaining some awareness, they attempted to communicate with another person but experienced confusion about time and reality, leading them to believe they were still deeply immersed in the experience.

In one of the most intense parts of the trip, an entity appeared that spoke to the participant with compassion. The entity described itself as something the individual would return to when ready and expressed love for the participant. When asked about reality, the entity likened it to a puddle's surface with lives being splashes across it.

The participant then felt tired and was told by the entity to rest. Following this, an apparition of a woman of light appeared briefly before vanishing. This was followed by a vision of pyramids with eyes on each side that began spinning and ascending while emitting light.

Overall, the experience included interactions with two entities: one described as an alien-like being and another as a woman of light. The participant also experienced visual distortions and feelings of awe and detachment from reality."
947,8669,"The user begins by inhaling a small amount of an unnamed substance but feels only mild effects, such as enhanced color perception and subtle spatial distortions. They then increase the dose, experiencing more pronounced effects including a sense of being on a cylindrical hallway where gravity seems less relevant. The user realizes that focusing is crucial to fully experience the substance's effects.

Upon further increasing the dosage, they enter a state characterized by internal voices speaking rhyming phrases like ""You're halfway to hell."" They visualize a spaceship waiting for them and feel an intense pull upwards, but are told they cannot board yet. This leads to severe spatial distortions similar to those experienced with mushrooms during peak effects.

The user then experiences a profound sense of being absorbed in their surroundings, feeling childlike and mentally interacting with the environment rather than thinking about it. They sit for several minutes relishing this state before concluding that more rapid dosing is necessary to achieve maximum effects."
948,33205,"The participant reported being shown ""unspeakable things"" and receiving answers to life's greatest secrets from a mysterious entity. This entity was described as kind and gentle, pulling the participant out of their body within seconds of the experience beginning. The participant felt suspended in a bodiless dimension, merging with existence and losing all sense of individuality.

The entity communicated telepathically, teaching the participant about the nature of consciousness and reality. It showed the participant what death would be like, revealing that consciousness is the basis of existence and that enlightenment is already present but often forgotten due to identification with roles and bodies.

The entity was described as a ""graceful divine being"" showering love and presence, reminding the participant of their true home in the universe. It took the participant on a cosmic journey, showing them their eternal nature and oneness with existence. The experience left the participant feeling transformed, with an altered consciousness that remained even after the effects wore off."
949,13211,"The individual begins by preparing for the experience, ensuring their environment is conducive to the journey. After inhaling the substance, they feel a detachment from their body, experiencing it as if floating above it and rocking back and forth. They are interrupted by someone urging them to leave, but they manage to continue.

In the next phase of the experience, the participant finds themselves in what seems like a circus setting, traveling rapidly through an indeterminate mode of transportation. The visuals become colorful and fragmented, with the individual perceiving various entities such as worms breaking through glass-like barriers and faces appearing around them. These entities are described as whispering voices that judge and communicate with the participant.

The experience includes moments of familiarity and relaxation, where the participant feels at ease despite the overwhelming sensory input. They encounter a doorway leading back to reality, marked by a return to recognizable colors and sounds, though still accompanied by residual visual and auditory effects.

Upon returning to their room, the individual reflects on the insights gained during the journey, noting themes of color, voices, familiarity, and relaxation that persist even after the experience concludes."
950,10121,"The individual began their session in a peaceful bedroom setting while alone. They experienced a strong physical pull sensation and attempted to control it by sitting cross-legged. As they continued, the music became overwhelming, leading them to turn it off for relief. The participant then felt an uneasy anticipation without any significant visual or auditory changes.

After consuming more of the substance, they noticed a carnival-like environment behind them, though not directly observed. This carnival was described as having a menacing atmosphere with plastic and tin toys. A presence beckoned them to join this carnival, which the participant sensed as malevolent but did not fear outright. They prayed and slowly moved away from the carnival, returning to their bedroom.

Upon opening their eyes, they found themselves back in their soft bedroom without any sign of the carnival or the entity. The entire experience felt longer than it actually was."
951,9084,"The individual sat in a dimly lit room after inhaling an unknown substance. They experienced visual distortions, with the environment appearing as if depicted in stained glass, where colors became solid and objects appeared vague. Words briefly appeared on the wall but were not remembered clearly. The participant then entered what they described as a ""CandyLand"" world.

In this CandyLand, various puppet-like beings emerged from the surroundings. These beings included toy soldiers and a female figure resembling Goldilocks. They were pale, had enormous blue eyes, and seemed intensely aware yet cold and detached. The beings worked together to create a candy cane fence around the participant, which felt like it was pulling them into their reality.

The CandyLand environment featured fresh white snow and glowing huts. A rhythmic hammering sound formed a musical backdrop for this world. As the experience progressed, the participant briefly returned to the physical room due to an external noise but then re-entered the hallucinatory state. In this return, they perceived the female figure emerging from the bed as a cloud of scattered light and felt a sense of welcome from her.

The overall experience had a multi-tiered reality feel, with the CandyLand world seeming like a production where the puppet-like beings were actually the puppeteers."
952,7966,"The participant took three hits of the substance in a quiet home setting with dim lighting and tranquil music. After holding each hit for about 25-30 seconds, their body felt heavy and gravity seemed random. They closed their eyes and saw giant visual slugs moving around them before coming out of this state after ten minutes.

They then took three more hits, the first being particularly strong. During these hits, they lost control over their voice which was used by another presence. After lying down under a dark blanket, they opened their eyes to see a large rock wall leading downwards into a cave. A small green and alien woman instructed them to descend.

The participant followed her through tunnels for what felt like years, eventually reaching a chamber with giant red stalactites. The alien woman had aged from a young child to an old woman during this time. She led the participant to a room with glowing crystals where she died before revealing her name. The participant was overwhelmed with joy at having been chosen to see this place.

After what felt like five years, they returned to their bedroom in about ten minutes. They experienced a pleasant body high for nearly an hour afterward and went to sleep."
953,23277,"The participant experienced intense pain in the left side of their back after inhaling a small amount of dried plant material. They perceived an entity referred to as ""Lady Salvia,"" who instructed them to push their consciousness down so that salvia energy could cover their entire body and heal them. Lady Salvia repeatedly told the participant, ""you're healed"" and explained that their broken heart was no longer causing sadness because it was no longer broken. She also mentioned that the lack of a job and inactivity were contributing factors to the depression.

The pain in the left side of the back and emotional distress subsided as Lady Salvia continued her healing process, coinciding with the turning on of ""The Simpsons"" by a friend named K. A calm sense of blissful happiness followed, allowing the participant to feel content and concentrate again for the first time in weeks."
954,7958,"The participant began feeling content while walking down a sunny road, thinking about various tasks and personal matters. Suddenly, they were hit by a bus and found themselves in an unfamiliar, stormy location with a strong magnetic field preventing them from moving freely. They experienced intense fear and confusion, believing this was reality rather than a dream. The background began to open up, revealing entities that resembled their former selves but had alien-like faces. These beings appeared to be from another dimension and seemed to have the power to manipulate the environment around them. The participant felt paralyzed and helpless as these beings approached, initially thinking they were there to take them back to their original world. However, the beings retreated, leaving the participant confused and disoriented. They then realized that this experience was due to a substance they had taken earlier and that they still had a connection to the physical world."
955,27352,"The participant began their experience in a natural setting with friends after consuming a small amount of acid earlier. They then smoked an unspecified quantity of dried plant material from improvised equipment. Upon inhaling three large hits, they experienced a rapid transition to a different environment where physical sensations faded and thoughts projected as 3D images.

In this altered state, the participant felt like they were falling down an endless spiral staircase made up of still frames from their recent experiences. They lost track of time and location, experiencing confusion but managing to calm themselves. A bright, pleasant environment followed, accompanied by a fast-forwarding film-like replay of significant life events, including early childhood memories.

The participant perceived enlightenment and felt intense happiness as they ascended towards white light before returning to blackness. Upon regaining consciousness in the physical world, they expressed disbelief at their experience and noted that it lasted only a few minutes subjectively.

After returning to baseline, the participant observed changes in perception of time and movement, feeling more accurate in estimating steps while walking on narrow ground. They also experienced an odd sensation of objects passing through them, particularly noticeable in their hands and fingertips for several days after the experience.

The next day, they repeated the process with similar but less intense effects. This time, they were able to communicate with friends and control some hallucinations by will. They saw faces emerge from sandstone, a puppy appear out of nowhere, and cartoon-like scenes on clouds. Shiny particles and cell-like structures also appeared in their field of vision.

Two friends reported encounters with entities during this second session but did not provide detailed descriptions."
956,24356,"The individual consumed an unspecified substance and experienced vivid hallucinations. They found themselves at what appeared to be a vast construction site with extensive scaffolding stretching endlessly in all directions. Three distinct entities were present: one neutral, one positive, and one negative. These entities were engaged in building the universe using tools such as a jackhammer-like device and a rope. Laughter was prevalent throughout the experience, both as an emotion felt by the participant and as a form of communication among the entities.

The participant communicated with their friend, who was observing them from a couch. The laughter became overwhelming at one point, enveloping the participant and making it difficult to understand spoken words. As the experience came to an end, the participant felt a sense of loss and sadness when the laughter diminished. They described the final drop of laughter as rolling off their lips and falling away into darkness.

The three entities bowed their heads in sorrow as the participant's experience concluded. The individual reflected on the parallels between the hallucinations and real-life objects or beliefs, such as the frosted glass door resembling scaffolding and the concept of positive, neutral, and negative forces."
957,7268,"The participant began the experience by smoking a substance from a bowl under a deck surrounded by a pool, construction sounds, and tropical plants. After taking two hits, they felt immobilized and experienced disassociation, with an inability to move their head or feel in control of themselves. They observed others trying to hold smoke but found it difficult to communicate their experience effectively.

The group then switched to smoking another substance from a glass bowl, which the participant described as enhancing the initial effects. They heard distorted sounds, such as music and construction noises blending into a techno beat, and felt an overwhelming appreciation for their environment, including tropical plants and sky patterns. The participant also experienced visual distortions like blue and green integrated beans.

Feeling very tired but still tripping intensely, they ate vanilla cookies slowly, experiencing the texture and taste vividly. They imagined eating cookie crisp cereal as a robot scooping rocks into a machine (their mouth) and felt like they were reeling in one of their friends with a fishing pole. The participant then smoked more from a bong filled with grape juice.

As the effects began to subside, the group mixed smoking sessions between two substances for about ten minutes. The participant took three heavy hits of one substance and four weed hits. They felt compelled by others to jump into a pool, where they experienced the water as masses of jelly-like beans pushing them around. Underwater with eyes closed, they imagined being a silhouette of a small girl in rags swimming under the sun."
958,19878,"The participant began their day by preparing a mixture of coca and salvia to chew. After about 15 minutes, they started feeling numbness from the coca and waves of effects from the salvia. The sensations were described as warm and mellow compared to smoking salvia alone. They kept the wad in their mouth for approximately 45 minutes, experiencing euphoria that lasted around 1.5-2 hours.

During this period, they engaged in cleaning activities which felt more significant and purposeful than usual. Objects seemed to have a specific place in the universe, and placing them there felt like correcting a small imperfection, making the world better for all living things. However, tasks such as doing laundry still felt mundane.

The participant remained productive throughout the day and experienced no issues with sleep or interactions with others."
959,19737,"The individual smoked salvia divinorum multiple times during one session. Initially, they experienced slight visual disturbances and a trippy feeling but decided to continue after procuring more of the substance. In their second attempt, they felt a change in cabin pressure and spatial dimensions, with objects appearing larger or closer than usual. They reported sweating profusely.

After smoking again, fractal patterns appeared on their eyelids and spread outwards. When opening their eyes, the bed seemed miles wide while the window was right beside them. The participant described this experience as strange, powerful, and intense. A friend also smoked a small amount and experienced similar but milder effects, including stretched room dimensions.

The individual then smoked more salvia, leading to a breakthrough where objects in the room became the basis for fractal spirals. They heard music that transported them to a wasteland setting with a girl on a fence who communicated through thoughts running like ticker tape. The room later appeared fluorescent pink and featured rotating green 2D fractals that disintegrated into cartoony, single-color units with faces.

These pixel-like creatures flooded the participant's view, causing dimensions to flip, twist, and stretch. When asked if they were alright, words had no meaning in this altered state. The experience was described as unique compared to other psychedelic substances, with hallucinations that seemed to integrate reality or have reality dictated by their laws."
960,19347,"The participant began experimenting with a substance after researching its effects and decided to try it alone for a more focused experience. During initial trips, they found that keeping their eyes closed was essential to maintain the altered state of consciousness. They experienced disassociation from their body and visual static images in their mind, accompanied by a sensation of being pulled or pushed by an unseen force.

The participant noted that external stimuli such as music or television could disrupt the experience, so they preferred meditating with minimal sensory input. After several trips, they felt more comfortable with the substance's effects and attempted to extend its duration during daytime use. This resulted in a feeling of heaviness in their eyes and a sense of drunkenness while still being able to function.

The participant perceived an entity named ""Lady Salvia,"" described as female and powerful, offering intense experiences similar to other hallucinogens but with quicker onset and offset. They concluded that the substance had spiritual benefits and allowed for immediate analysis of thoughts during trips."
961,19190,"The participant experienced a strong initial sensation after taking an unspecified substance, followed by difficulty in communicating their experience to others due to feelings of discomfort and potential betrayal if they spoke about it. They felt encumbered, as if gravity had increased significantly on their head and arms. The room appeared to bend into an oval shape influenced by the music playing. There was a persistent feeling that only immediate surroundings were real, while adjacent rooms existed in some undefined state. To confirm reality, the participant went to the kitchen but this partially brought them back to normal awareness. They then engaged in conversation with another person (T.) about their experiences and had dinner together."
962,12595,"In a hotel room restroom, the participant smoked a large dose of an extract substance from a bong while listening to music. They felt a pressure sensation pushing inward on their body before being transported into what they perceived as a tube-like structure filled with rapidly moving reds, greens, and blues. Outside this tube were multiple female figures cheering them on with phrases like ""you're doing it"" and ""you're almost there."" The participant experienced anxiety and confusion about their surroundings and the presence of these women. They had fragmented memories and tried to recall who they were before being 'squirted' out of the structure back into the hotel room after approximately 10 minutes. Upon returning, they found themselves in a Las Vegas hotel room with the CD player nearing the end of track 5. The trip lasted about 10 minutes from start to finish."
963,18218,"The participant sat in a dark room after inhaling a substance, experiencing visual hallucinations of a black void with a windmill-like object composed of flat blades turning together. They felt themselves being pushed forward along a track powered by the rotating blades. A feminine presence communicated through non-verbal laughter and was depicted as a skinny black figure with long rubbery fingers and large round white eyes. The participant then experienced movement in different directions, including backwards, left, and right.

A male presence appeared later, causing an unpleasant sensation akin to being dragged facedown in loose gravel. This entity was also described as having a squiggly black ink-like appearance under strange clothing. The participant eventually stopped the movement by willfully manipulating their sense of motion and communicated a mental statement to the entities, resulting in their gradual disappearance."
964,17580,"The individual began their trip by holding a large dose of tincture sublingually, causing intense physical sensations and hallucinations. In the first chapter, they encountered an old folksey lady and her husband as cartoon-like entities who coached them through the experience. The participant felt transformed into a corn god with the urge to announce their divinity but resisted it. They also experienced vivid imagery of a corn farm.

In the second chapter, the individual perceived themselves as part of a race of Giant Machines working in gardens under the direction of Alkabitius Dominko. They interacted with other entities such as a Work Director and Robot Flowers. The experience lasted approximately two hours before returning to normal consciousness."
965,14915,"The individual prepared for the experience by painting and meditating, aiming for a state of relaxation and openness. After ingesting the substance, they experienced intense visual and auditory hallucinations, including patterns that seemed to overlay their immediate surroundings. They felt profound introspection, connecting with past, present, and future selves, and understanding the inner workings of their thoughts and memories. The experience brought on feelings of fear and overwhelming power, as well as a sense of isolation and disconnection from others. The individual began writing down their emotions and thoughts, struggling to capture the intensity of their mental activity. They felt an urge to create art, which they did with a sense of precision and inevitability. By six o'clock, the experience had ended, leaving them feeling refreshed and clear-headed."
966,7659,"The participant began their session by meditating and preparing for the experience. They then inhaled the substance deeply, feeling disoriented almost immediately upon inhalation. Their inner monologue became louder and more intense, making them feel as if they were speaking to someone else. As the effects intensified, the participant lost all sense of identity and felt a feminine presence nearby, reminiscent of their mother or a primal Mother Goddess.

Visual phenomena included indistinct shapes that transformed into an endless line of people walking like a caravan through the desert when the participant closed their eyes. The experience was brief but intense, lasting less than half an hour before the effects gradually diminished. The participant felt mellow and lethargic for some time after the trip ended."
967,11874,"The participant visited a friend's house with the intention of trying Salvia divinorum again after a year-long break. They smoked a mixture containing both Salvia and marijuana, which added an unwanted dimension to their experience due to sensitivity to marijuana. The initial hit produced familiar sensations such as prickles and pulling to the right, but this time it continued further.

The participant found themselves in a world made of drab reddish-brownish-yellowish crosshatch crinkle patterns that resembled swastikas painted by an artist's brush. Their family appeared within these patterns, telling them matter-of-factly that this was how the universe truly is and would be for eternity. The experience felt like a revelation of a bleak, almost two-dimensional reality, causing anguish as they realized they could never return to their previous life.

The participant perceived their friend as a lifeless husk, supporting the illusion of normalcy until it too began to change into the salvia world. They struggled with the feeling that they were trapped in this system and had to either accept it or fruitlessly struggle against it. The experience lasted for about 5 minutes before the participant started to return to their usual consciousness.

Upon returning, the participant felt their body and perception reintegrating as if the crinkles were being ironed out. It took them around 20 minutes to fully come back and an hour afterward they were still shaking from the shock of the experience."
968,5514,"The individual began their experience in a dimly lit room with music playing. After inhaling salvia, they experienced intense coughing and panic due to the bitter taste of the smoke. They perceived a comforting presence of a nurse who assured them everything was okay and guided them through the experience. The nurse encouraged the participant to drink water and continue their activity. Following this, the individual moved to their room where they felt the nurse's presence sitting on the bed while they painted. Throughout the session, the participant maintained a peaceful and detached state of mind."
969,5447,"The participant prepared carefully before consuming an unnamed substance, moving furniture to create more space in their living room. They smoked a small amount of the substance and experienced visual distortions where walls seemed to wrap around them in a fisheye-like manner. The experience was characterized by alternating sensations: one direction featured a roar of echoed sound with an unfamiliar voice, while the opposite direction had a zipper-like rift in reality leading to a void. This void evoked deep emotional guilt and remorse for trespassing on a threshold. After this peak experience, which lasted about five minutes, the participant lost physical control but remained conscious, hurtling uncontrollably through their apartment. They expressed regret at not having a sitter present and emphasized the need for caution when using the substance."
970,5144,"The individual began their experience at 6:15 PM after consuming a substance in conjunction with hash oil and smoking it through a bong. They felt an intense awareness of their physical body as part of a larger entity. A third entity was perceived as having a strong African presence, acting as a teacher preparing them for a lesson.

Visual hallucinations included large rings flowing from the bed to the sky, which shifted with movement and seemed to guide the individual's position. The participant felt they were dissolving into their bed and pillow, sensing that these objects too were made of flesh and part of one living body. Music played during this phase intensified the experience, with visual patterns forming at every beat.

The initial phase was accompanied by involuntary laughter as the mind reacted to the physical sensations. After opening their eyes around 6:40 PM, they engaged in conversation with a companion and touched objects with wonder at their tactile qualities. The experience continued into dinner, where food felt like it dissolved in the mouth. The duration of effects was extended due to hash oil consumption."
971,11716,"The participant smoked an unknown substance twice. The first bowl had little effect, but after the second one, perception altered significantly. The individual experienced being in both a physical room and an ethereal space simultaneously. In this ethereal space, there were uncountable thousands of beings and a sea of energy. They felt powerful and able to choose which realm to focus on. After about three minutes, they returned to the physical room with little effect remaining."
972,3785,"The individual reported feeling their consciousness spread across three-dimensional space after consuming a substance. They heard footsteps from someone walking up the stairs in an old wooden hotel and felt themselves merging with that person, as well as the door they opened. The participant experienced a sense of interconnectedness between all things, including themselves, the other person, the door, and the hotel.

During this experience, the individual encountered entities that seemed to communicate, asking ""what are you doing here?"" They also perceived an infinite wall with villi-like protuberances representing various awarenesses. This surface was in constant flux, with new protuberances emerging and being reabsorbed, possibly symbolizing life and death.

The experience lasted about 15 minutes, after which the participant returned to a normal state but initially only remembered the image of the infinite wall of consciousnesses facing oncoming time. The full recollection came later, the next day in the shower."
973,3319,"The participant began experiencing severe pain but felt determined to continue despite it. They were shrouded in darkness at first but as the experience progressed, the darkness dissipated. Memories of loved ones flooded their mind before fading away, leaving them with an intense fear and emptiness. The participant then perceived a vast plane filled with constant motion and life, though they remained connected to what they considered the mortal world.

A voice identified as God responded to the participant's plea for release, telling them they were not ready and to return to the mortal realm. This interaction intensified their terror but also provided clarity about their situation. The experience lasted approximately 30 seconds before the participant exhaled the smoke, followed by an additional 10 minutes of intense emotions and sensations.

After the initial trip, the participant struggled to re-assimilate into reality for around 30 minutes. They noted heavy sweating along their calf muscles during this period."
974,2694,"The participant experienced altered states of consciousness after using an unspecified substance multiple times. During one session, they felt like a child again, hearing names of siblings and imagining their kitchen as the center of their world. Another time, they perceived perfect symmetry in their visual field and felt as if everything was under studio lights, leading to daydreaming.

In a more profound experience, after consuming a larger dose before sleep, the participant had vivid dreams that seemed real and continuous. The dream involved being chased by police through various settings like shopping malls and bridges. They interacted with arcade games and experienced sensory details such as rain and lightning strikes. These dreams were influenced by recent thoughts and conversations.

Subsequent nights yielded similar but less intense experiences."
975,2642,"The individual began their experience lying in bed after smoking a small amount of a substance. They felt prickly all over and had difficulty moving to their bed due to unsteadiness. With eyes closed, they experienced mild visual phenomena before transitioning into an operating room setting where female entities were present. One entity responded with a strange look, winked, and laughed when spoken to. The individual then floated through a space filled with bright lights, able to change the surroundings by willing it. After the experience ended, they gradually regained their senses."
976,9526,"The participant experienced intense feelings of terror initially but then felt a profound sense of unity with all life forms. They were shown images of vast cosmic landscapes, including canyons and galaxies, which made them feel as though they had traveled through multiple universes. The experience included encountering a nurturing mother figure who was described as cradling the inevitability of existence without shame. This encounter reinforced a sense of unity and interconnectedness among all living beings."
977,307,"The individual reported two distinct experiences after consuming a substance. In the first experience, they perceived small entities, possibly children, playing in a forest-like setting. These entities were described as frolicky and happy.

In the second experience, following several inhalations of an extract, the participant experienced visual distortions where objects such as the bong, carpet, and walls appeared to have similar rectangular patterns. They then heard a voice from their right side that said ""Hey you."" Responding in their head with ""Yes?"", the voice replied ""Mine,"" followed by a hand emerging from underneath them and grabbing towards some fallen leaves around the base of the bong before slowly retracting.

The participant then engaged in dialogue with this entity, asking why it felt a certain way and what was needed to change. The entity responded with ""Hate you"" and later said ""Try."" This interaction lasted for several minutes before the effects began to taper off. The experience was described as dreamlike, without feelings of surprise or threat."
978,102325,"The participant began by smoking an herbal extract in a barn setting, experiencing intense fear and a sensation of being taken over by a ""spidery"" feeling. They felt as if their identity was cast aside and the air around them became thick and hazy. The individual heard distant calls for boarding, sensing they were in a train station and wanting to stay with their mother. Physical effects included difficulty walking and feeling cold.

In a subsequent session, the participant smoked more of the extract inside a hoop house. They experienced rapid onset of fear again but also saw faces and images in plastic reflections, which later coalesced into a vision of being part of an aluminum bleacher at a baseball game from a unique perspective. The individual then focused on a hole in the plastic revealing a brick wall, anticipating someone walking into view.

Simultaneously, they had three overlapping visions: one in a pinkish-red space with other spirits confirming their presence in the 13/14th dimension; another of a crib in an apartment from early childhood; and a third involving a crocheted blanket patterned like a sine wave. These visions faded as the participant returned to reality, feeling a sense of personal growth and acceptance.

The experience concluded with a pleasant glow and a realization that everyday life was profoundly important despite not fully understanding why."
979,118422,"The participant experienced multiple shifts in consciousness after inhaling a substance, likely through a bong. Each shift was marked by a distinct sound similar to books being dropped on a solid floor. With each sound, the individual's perspective changed, inhabiting different bodies and settings. The experiences were vivid and felt very real. One notable setting included looking out into a rainforest from what appeared to be a tent or yurt. The participant noted that these shifts occurred rapidly and repeatedly, with many distinct perspectives experienced in quick succession."
980,67464,"The individual experienced a series of sessions with a psychedelic substance. In the first session, after consuming small doses, they felt a slight pull to the right, enhanced colors, and difficulty concentrating. A second attempt resulted in more pronounced effects: the room skewed 45 degrees to the right, their body felt open, especially from the back of the head, and there was no pain associated with these sensations.

In a subsequent session, larger doses were consumed. The participant reported feeling very light initially but then experienced gravity pulling them down while the left side of their body dissolved into reality. Reality appeared as a pink latex membrane folding over from right to left. They effortlessly moved their arm through this membrane and felt it peeling away like pages turning in a book, leading to a melting sensation.

The experience was not frightening, but rather felt weird due to the folding and turning sensations. The participant maintained some detachment, preventing fear or panic. They expressed interest in exploring further with the substance for potential self-discovery."
981,76764,"The individual began by smoking a bong filled with salvia extract and immediately felt its effects. They started laughing uncontrollably before experiencing visual distortions where their surroundings appeared shattered, making it difficult for them to perceive reality clearly. While on the floor trying to crawl through this altered state, an entity grabbed them by the head and pushed them back down repeatedly while saying ""to the minus 7"" over and over again.

The experience lasted approximately two to three minutes before the visual distortions began to merge back together, allowing the individual to recognize their surroundings. They were still disoriented and found themselves in a state where they could not move freely due to heavy gravity-like sensations. After regaining motor skills, they stood up and felt truly back to normal.

Their friends reported that during the experience, the participant slid from the couch like a ball, crawled around talking gibberish, and asked for help before attempting to tunnel between furniture."
982,56515,"The participant began to feel light-headed after taking multiple hits from a water pipe filled with a potent form of the drug. They laid down on the floor as their experience intensified. Music became louder, and they perceived their life as a visual timeline, with each second represented by vibrant, colorful segments. The participants felt small compared to others in the room who seemed unaffected.

The participant believed they understood the nature of life but quickly dismissed this realization, feeling uncomfortable about it. They experienced auditory hallucinations, hearing creaking noises that they initially interpreted as coming from a giant's foot before realizing it was their hamster. 

They observed themselves moving along the timeline, sitting up and then lying back down in accordance with what they saw. The participant felt scared but also calm at times during this experience. They interacted with friends who were present, including their fiancée, who helped them sit up when indicated by the timeline.

The music played during the trip was particularly intense for the participant, feeling as if it had been written specifically for that moment. After drinking water, perception returned to normal, and the overall experience left the participant feeling humbled."
983,66910,"The participant began by smoking a substance from a glass pipe, experiencing initial physical sensations of heaviness and tingling. They felt air was denser and their sense of touch was amplified. A sensation of being pulled forward, as if out of the body, occurred, which they tried to counteract by changing positions.

Focusing on surroundings, everything appeared fragmented, similar to a frame-by-frame movie. The dresser took on an unusual presence, seeming larger than usual and alive, attempting to convey abstract concepts about life and existence. The participant moved to their computer, where the screen visuals and music had a more powerful presence, with light appearing three-dimensional and sounds visualized as shapes and colors.

After approximately 20 minutes, the main effects began to subside, leaving the participant feeling slightly strange for another 10-15 minutes."
984,70636,"The participant, an experienced user of various substances, decided to try salvia for the first time. They prepared by taking small doses over several days to get accustomed to its effects. On the day of the main experience, they used a bong loaded with salvia leaves and a pinch of 10x extract while sitting in their yard.

Initially, the participant felt relaxed and entered a familiar visual state that was hard to describe but not fearful. However, unbeknownst to them, they were making loud guttural moans and laughing maniacally. Their husband heard this from across the house and came to check on them, finding the bong and extra hit on the ground.

The participant had no recollection of these physical actions or sounds during their experience. They felt surprised by the unexpected reactions but remained intrigued and not scared by the event."
985,70582,"The participant called their friend R to join them for an experience with a substance purchased from a local head shop. After preparing a bowl with a small amount of the substance, the participant inhaled it but only experienced slight visual distortions and uncontrollable laughter. They then prepared a larger dose and inhaled it, leading to more pronounced effects.

The participant reported tunnel vision as if being sucked into their Grateful Dead tapestry. Bars made of bricks from Mario games appeared and locked onto the back of the couch. The room tilted backward with holes where items like the TV were located, creating an illusion similar to a ski lift moving slowly before lunging forward. This led to the participant feeling as though they were floating in an alien sky filled with clouds.

The experience included flashes of memories that seemed to belong to other people. These memories ranged from walking down a road in New York City during what appeared to be the 1950s, to sitting at a childhood birthday party. The participant then saw their sister standing on the front of the ""ski lift"" but she was only seven years old or so.

The experience continued with the participant entering the body of another person, an 18-year-old boy in what seemed like WW2 France, searching for a girl who looked similar to their sister. The participant felt compelled to protect this younger version of their sister.

After these experiences, the participant returned to their couch and asked R what time it was, only to find that less than ten minutes had passed since they first inhaled the substance."
986,70583,"The individual prepared for the experience by going to a quiet basement and listening to music. After inhaling the substance, they felt detached from reality and observed themselves on a sofa as if from above. They perceived multiple distinct figures who attempted to coax them into another state of consciousness but were resisted. The participant experienced an intense zoomed-out view of their surroundings before returning to normal reality. The effects gradually faded away, leaving pleasant aftereffects."
987,78566,"The participant had two experiences that were markedly different due to their settings and mental states. 

In the first episode, set in a giant Pacific Northwest Evergreen Forest along the Puget Sound, the individual felt anxious and excited before inhaling the substance. After inhalation, they experienced an overwhelming wave of sensations that left them paralyzed with ecstasy but also uncomfortable. They were unable to find comfort despite their efforts, feeling itchy from pine needles and disturbed by a dragonfly's presence. The environment seemed unappealing, and there was constant background noise from friends and nature. Two minutes into the experience, confusion set in as they wondered about the purpose of these sensations. One minute later, they decided to open their eyes and regain some physical awareness, feeling drunk and needing assistance to stand up.

In the second episode, conducted in a small apartment with reggae music playing, the individual felt more optimistic and prepared for an enjoyable experience. Upon inhaling, they saw strange visuals and immediately felt waves of bliss spreading through their body. They entered a state between consciousness and unconsciousness, feeling like pure love and an orgasmic wave of ecstasy. The song's rhythm and lyrics enhanced this euphoric state, creating vivid visualizations of sunsets and evergreen trees that cast a spell on their emotions. There was a sense of being guided towards the hallway light while shifting and spiraling. As the music progressed, they felt an overwhelming urge to let go of their physical body and remain in this blissful realm. However, as the song ended after 4:44 minutes, so did the intense presence and visuals, leaving them with a lingering feeling of paranoia about returning to reality.

Both experiences were characterized by altered states of consciousness, vivid visualizations, and strong emotional responses, though the first was more uncomfortable while the second was highly enjoyable."
988,12471,"The participant prepared for their first experience by reading about it online and having a friend present as a sitter. They smoked a large dose of an extract through a wooden pipe, experiencing a familiar taste and feeling. Physical sensations included a prickly pins-and-needles sensation throughout the body. The participant reported hearing music in their head that they were creating on the spot, accompanied by fractal patterns moving clockwise.

The experience involved the perception of three entities: one male and two females. These entities communicated directly with the participant's brain without using senses like sight or sound. They urged the participant to ""release"" and join them, attempting to pull the participant from their body. The interaction was not frightening but rather welcoming. However, the participant remained partially aware of their physical surroundings, including the couch and sounds from their friend playing video games.

The peak experience lasted about five minutes before gradually subsiding. Upon returning to reality, the participant felt disoriented and smoked marijuana to ease the comedown, which lasted around an hour and a half. In the following weeks, the participant noticed changes in thought patterns, becoming more aware of plants and trees."
989,12469,"The participant experienced an altered state where they perceived themselves outside their physical body, watching events unfold as if through walls. They then found themselves on a spinning platform that repeatedly divided them and another person into multiple versions of themselves. After opening their eyes, everything appeared strange and their thoughts were abstract. The participant felt people leaving their house and imagined these individuals detaching from their body. This led to a brief paranoia/anxiety attack before the effects dissipated."
990,12388,"The individual experienced heightened sensory perception while sitting on their porch. They noticed an increased awareness of sounds, such as a car passing by, which seemed more pronounced than usual. The outdoor scenery appeared more vivid and alive, reminiscent of a familiar state achieved during another substance use experience. The participant felt a clear mind with a cartoonish visual quality to the surroundings. This heightened state lasted approximately 12-15 minutes, followed by a peaceful, serene feeling described as nearly zen-like in its calm beauty."
991,25265,"The participant first tried the substance at Glastonbury Festival 2003 after reading about it online but did not feel any significant effects from a small dose. Later, they consumed approximately 1/4 gram through a triple-chambered bong. Initially, there were no noticeable changes, but soon after, the participant perceived one of their friends as an evil parrot, though this was more of a mental perception rather than a visual change. The surroundings appeared to be made out of water with a shimmering haze around objects.

The individual felt that reality did not exist and experienced a split vision effect where the bottom half seemed to slip away while the top half was a fake version of reality. They perceived evil everywhere and believed they were on a different plane of existence. The participant lost control over their body movements, could not feel their face, and had no coordination. They put their head in their hands and waited for the experience to end.

The trip lasted what felt like an extended period but was relatively short according to friends who were present. Afterward, the individual regained sanity but did not act normally for a few days."
992,11986,"The participant had a surprising experience after smoking a substance from Mexico through a waterpipe while under the influence of Adderall. About 10 seconds after inhaling, they noticed their surroundings split into vertical triangular sections or pennants, each appearing on different levels and moving towards them as they tried to move or talk. The room seemed like a 3D picture with staircases leading nowhere, and everything rotated in a mechanical counter-clockwise motion.

The participant felt restrained, unable to speak or move freely without being pushed back and down. They laughed at the visuals but could not communicate effectively with their friends. After about one minute, the visual distortions disappeared, though they still had difficulty speaking. The experience was intense and left them in awe of a forgotten realm that seemed constantly present yet never seen before."
993,15608,"The participant began their experience by smoking Salvia in a dark room after work. They felt an immediate onset of visual disturbances, including pressure and numbness sensations. As the effects intensified, they saw elephants' trunks attached to their face, which multiplied into four directions. These trunks formed beautiful, morphing patterns as 70's music played. A man dressed in 70's clothing appeared but did not speak; the participant felt an odd sense of owing him something. After this vision faded, they saw a trunk re-attached to their face and experienced confusion about being stuck against a wall. The trip ended abruptly with the realization that these events were hallucinations. They returned to reality in the same position as when the trip started, feeling relieved but mentally exhausted."
994,36753,"Four friends gathered in a living room to try salvia. Two of them quickly showed signs of strong effects, with one running out of the room and laughing uncontrollably while the other spoke to himself and walked into corners. The narrator and another friend continued smoking but initially felt nothing. After about five minutes, the narrator began experiencing mild tingling sensations and a slight disorientation. They described feeling ""stoned but different,"" with altered perceptions of color and difficulty functioning normally or carrying on conversations. Time seemed distorted, and the effects lasted longer than expected, continuing into the night. The narrator and one friend remained affected for several hours, unable to drive until at least 9:30 PM."
995,36644,"The participant began by smoking marijuana and then used Salvia. After inhaling, they experienced a powerful auditory hallucination where an authoritative voice told them they would die unless they ate something from their fridge that was made of ""the inside of the ladder."" The individual became convinced this was real and entered a state of intense panic, struggling to breathe. They woke up their girlfriend and together they searched the fridge for the item but could not find it. Despite the girlfriend's attempts to calm them down, the participant remained in a heightened state of anxiety and fear of death for several hours. The experience lasted about 3 hours before the individual began to realize they were tripping and eventually fell asleep. Upon waking up the next day, they felt detached from reality but were relieved to be alive."
996,20208,"The participant first attempted to use dried leaves by chewing them, which resulted in nausea but no other effects after 30 minutes. They then switched to smoking the substance using a custom-built water bong. After taking several hits, they experienced an overwhelming onset that was somewhat controllable. During the experience, the participant felt as though their body had disappeared and only their thoughts remained. They suddenly found themselves in a fluent Spanish-speaking state, despite not knowing any Spanish. The participant then imagined standing on a strange country road, feeling familiar with the surroundings. As the effects wore off after about an hour, they were left somewhat confused."
997,110071,"The individual began their experience immediately after inhaling smoke from a bowl containing both regular leaves and extract of an unspecified substance. They felt detached from their surroundings and experienced coldness and subdued thoughts. As they held in the smoke, they saw a scene where their lungs extended into tube-like shapes against a yellow background before losing all sense of body.

In this state, the participant found themselves in a dark space with specks of light, feeling as though they were moving quickly through outer space. They then entered what felt like a tunnel, encountering a vibrating wall that emitted familiar voices. Despite attempts to merge with it, an unseen force kept them at bay until the voices grew louder and they opened their eyes.

Returning to reality, the participant was confused and had difficulty understanding or controlling their body. A force repeatedly pulled them back into different scenes, including one filled with bright geometric patterns. Each return to the room brought slightly more comprehension of the surroundings, eventually recognizing friends who were leaving.

Feeling alone, the individual crawled into bed and entered a half-dream state where they explored a three-dimensional geometric world. They drifted off to sleep after what felt like hours but was likely minutes, waking up nine hours later with a sense of relief at being aware and present in their body again."
998,15821,"The participant began by smoking approximately 0.25 grams of a homemade Salvia leaf extract using a marble pipe. They took several slow hits, interspersed with small breaths of fresh air to avoid throat irritation. After a few minutes, they noticed an unusual movement in a wall lamp that seemed independent of their head movements.

As the effects intensified, the participant felt a pulling sensation urging them to recline on their bed. While lying down, they experienced mild mental images of green waves of watery energy rolling lazily around them. These impressions were somewhat vague and dreamlike when eyes were open in the room.

The participant then had an impression of being in a countryside-like setting with these green waves running through it. They perceived several other entities urging them to ride on the waves using a jet-ski made of the same green wave material. The experience was described as pleasant, effortless, and fluid.

After a few minutes, the participant returned to their room feeling relaxed and peaceful. By this point, they had smoked all of the Salvia extract but were too relaxed to continue."
999,19110,"The participant consumed an extract made from 4 lbs of cactus, mixed with Mountain Dew. About an hour after starting to drink the juice, they experienced a gradual onset of effects similar to mild acid use, characterized by colorful and glowing visual patterns. They felt a strong desire to grin and engaged in activities such as walking around their backyard and watching a movie.

During the film ""Donnie Darko,"" the participant smoked salvia, leading to intense and rapid sensory experiences. The events of the movie took on cosmic significance, and characters appeared unreal or dead. A friend and his girlfriend were perceived as hieroglyphs with an angular white line connecting their mouths, representing their communication.

The effects of salvia were brief but intense, causing discomfort and a sense of being overwhelmed. After the experience ended abruptly, the participant expressed relief without fully explaining what had happened to their friends."
1000,15823,"The participant began their experience in a happy and excited mood while at a friend's cabin. After smoking three bowls of the substance over 15 minutes, they experienced visual distortions and an out-of-body sensation. At around 7:00, they smoked marijuana, which intensified their perception of being outside their body. By 12:00, they could view their body from any angle but struggled to re-enter it, feeling depressed and paranoid by 60:00. They gradually returned to normal vision by 2:00:00 and were fully down by 4:15:00. During the experience, they interacted with friends who appeared unaffected and continued their activities."
1001,46137,"The narrator, along with a friend, took an unknown substance at a bar on college night. After inhaling the substance, the narrator immediately felt a force pushing from the right side and fell onto someone beside them. They appeared to be unconscious but were actually experiencing vivid hallucinations in their mind. In these hallucinations, they saw themselves being pushed into another dimension with a white aura where thousands of people were going through different doors. When asked what was happening, an entity told them it was the end of the world and that everyone would be separated for testing. The narrator became scared and screamed for help.

After about five minutes, a stranger grabbed their hand and brought them back to reality. They found themselves on a deck with several people who had been watching them. The other friend who tried the substance did not return to the bar after taking it but ended up at his doorstep later that night with vague memories of the experience. Both friends experienced intense effects from the substance, though their experiences differed."
1002,85147,"The narrator and two friends traveled to a head shop where they purchased salvia. Upon returning home, the narrator's friend Jay ingested the substance first, exhibiting unusual behavior such as rapid speech and difficulty standing. The narrator then took their turn, experiencing an intense visual hallucination characterized by brightly colored geometric shapes sprouting from between their legs and feeling as if every cell of their body was being moved forward by a conveyor belt. They also reported moving through invisible cut-out shapes resembling their silhouette and witnessing bizarre, beautiful creations in a colorful world. The room appeared to crack and form small, blurry creatures that shifted into other beings while the narrator felt like they were spinning in an orbit around this novel environment. After the trip, both individuals smoked cannabis and experienced heightened effects from it."
1003,89460,"The individual prepared for their experience in a calm environment but was overwhelmed by intense visuals shortly after inhalation. They felt as if they were navigating through various surreal landscapes, including cartoon worlds and different planes of existence. During this time, they perceived an unceasing sound that seemed to be connected to a powerful entity, which they described as an angry child of infinite proportions. This entity appeared to sense their presence and was furious at the intrusion from the real world.

The participant experienced intense panic and fear, believing they were in danger of never returning to sobriety or sanity. They fought against this perceived threat by focusing on the certainty that all experiences must pass. Gradually, the terrifying peak subsided, and the surroundings became recognizable again after about fifteen minutes. The individual felt recovered from the trauma within another thirty minutes but was left with a lingering sense of panic."
1004,66616,"The participant had previously tried a different plant-based substance and was now attempting a new one for the first time. During this attempt, they experienced cold extremities, cold sweat, and anxiety. The next day, accompanied by a friend who was skeptical about the effects, the participant consumed a larger dose of the substance.

Initially, the friend felt 'good' but then perceived the room moving towards him and saw the participant's face and voice change into that of a witch. The participant experienced flat visuals with bright colors and felt like an aquatic animal in an alien underwater world. They lost their sense of identity during this phase.

As the trip progressed, the participant felt as if they were being pulled out of water by an alien force to be eaten, experiencing intense fear and screaming uncontrollably. This sensation was described as similar to a lamb being dragged to slaughter without purpose. The friend reported that the participant's eyes became empty, forehead sweaty, and they screamed loudly before attempting to get up but could not be restrained.

The trip ended with the room reforming in front of their eyes and the friend whispering for them to quiet down. Aftereffects were felt throughout the night, with a lingering sensation of being partially disconnected from reality."
1005,68516,"The narrator visited a friend in an affluent neighborhood to try a new substance. After watching his friend smoke the substance, the narrator took two hits from a pipe. Immediately after exhaling, he began uncontrollably laughing for several minutes. His body felt confused with shifting sensations of gravity and movement. The laughter subsided quickly and he experienced some physical disorientation before regaining control. He apologized to his friend for drooling but was told there was no drool. After sitting on the floor and then standing up, he regained stability and sat back on the bed in a daze. They went outside where the narrator continued to feel affected by the experience for several hours."
1006,116724,"In a quiet meadow within Vondel Park, the participant had a psychedelic experience after consuming an unknown substance. Initially, they saw fractal patterns multiplying the sitter's face. The experience then transported them to a supermarket where they felt lost and disconnected from reality. As the effects intensified, the participant experienced their body splitting in two, creating a strong sensation of emptiness inside.

An entity appeared behind them, taking something from their chest and tearing it off, marking a breakthrough moment. In this state, the participant described themselves as an atom of pure energy within a dimension they felt belonged to them. The dimensions overlapped, making it difficult to describe the experience accurately.

After some time, the participant opened their eyes but remained bewildered, unsure if the experience was over or not. They eventually returned to reality with difficulty, feeling that there was a fragile thread connecting them to ordinary consciousness. In the days following, they noticed an energy center in their chest and felt reborn, as if a veil had been lifted from their perception of reality.

The participant struggled to integrate this profound experience into their daily life, questioning what is real and engaging in periods of intense overthinking. They found it challenging to discuss the experience with others who hadn't undergone similar journeys. The integration process took years and involved meditation, studying art, and reading about mystical experiences."
1007,116666,"The participant began sitting in their bed facing away from two large French doors that were the only source of light in the room. After inhaling the substance through a water pipe, they immediately felt pulled towards the window by an unseen force. The participant panicked and called out for it to stop, unable to form words and screaming uncontrollably.

The experience included visual distortions where objects lost their differentiation and became shapes or blobs. There was a sensation of melting into the bed and being pulled apart like a block of candy strips. The participant felt as though they had ceased to exist physically, with no connection to their body. Their arms were initially outstretched and then began flailing uncontrollably.

In the second half of the experience, auditory hallucinations occurred while lying sideways on the bed, facing the door. The participant heard their mother calling but could not understand her words or see her. They offered a pencil to what they thought was their mother without realizing she wasn't actually there. As the effects wore off, the participant became aware of their surroundings again and felt physically heavy and dizzy.

After the experience, the participant felt physically and mentally exhausted, trembling for some time and remaining anxious for the rest of the day."
1008,69519,"The participant experienced visual distortions and enhanced emotions after ingesting a substance. They felt colors more vividly and perceived patterns in their surroundings. While outside, they observed people driving by and felt an overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction with modern technology and its impact on daily life. The participant then returned to their friend's house where they engaged in drawing, creating pictures that seemed to have deeper meaning.

Later, the participant smoked a substance with another friend, leading to intense hallucinations. They saw kaleidoscopic patterns, experienced a sensation of being inside a yellow plastic bear, and witnessed mirror images of people running away from them. The hallucinations were described as both strange and comforting, without the usual negative side effects like fear or discomfort."
1009,70253,"The participant began their experience by consuming a mixture of Salvia and marijuana with a friend. Upon inhaling, they immediately felt disoriented and transported to a new dimension. In this altered state, their cousin transformed into a smiling lady wearing a softly rainbow-colored gown and hat, whom the participant referred to as the ""Queen of the Carnival."" The Queen invited the participant onto a pink feather pillow that took them on a gentle, carnival-like journey.

After leaving the carnival ride, the participant found themselves inside the mind of a giant being, feeling both out of control yet at ease. They attempted to communicate with their cousin but could only manage a mumbled whisper. This led to a period of laughter and dancing around the apartment as they felt like a time traveler, repeatedly experiencing the same moment in time.

The participant then experienced a sense of disconnection from reality, feeling trapped between dimensions. They perceived a picture on the wall as three-dimensional and continued to feel detached for several hours after the initial effects wore off."
1010,116289,"The participant began by soaking 4.15 grams of leaves in cold water for ten minutes before chewing on them every ten seconds. At around 18:15, they reported a light body high and sedation, with their wall tapestry appearing to shrink and expand. By 18:26, after swallowing the chewed substance, they felt tired and experienced visual distortions such as tracers and outlines around their fingers. The room seemed to whip back and forth, making it difficult to stand.

The participant laid in bed listening to calm psytrance music, feeling heavy-headed and detached from reality. They perceived their room as being in a large white space, possibly influenced by the snow outside. Time perception was altered; what felt like minutes or days passed quickly. When standing up, they almost fell over due to dizziness.

They experienced intense thoughts and felt disconnected from themselves, even perceiving actions like putting on headphones as if done by a robot. The music caused them to see a moving grid with opacity 30%. Nausea developed around 19:10, accompanied by green urine. They interacted briefly with their brother, feeling unusually irritable.

By 19:40, the effects were lighter but still present, with slight body high and altered personality traits such as increased irritability. The participant could see outlines of objects even with closed eyes, allowing them to navigate the room without fully opening their eyes. By 20:16, the effects had subsided, leaving a neutral feeling with some sedation and light sensitivity."
1011,85754,"The participant began by consuming a significant amount of a psychoactive compound. Upon inhalation, they felt an overwhelming urge to escape their surroundings and reality itself. This led them to kick open a bathroom door where they encountered a friend who was unresponsive to the situation. The individual then experienced a surge of energy, feeling as though they were in the midst of an atomic explosion.

They perceived themselves transformed into a rubber 3-prong lego with a brain, tasting like burning car tires. Fear set in when they realized their new form and questioned whether their previous life was merely a dream. The participant's mother appeared as a lego, speaking to them and reassuring that they were ""a real smart lego"" who needed to calm down.

Other family members also materialized as legos, repeating the same message of reassurance. The individual felt watched and laughed at for their human-like behavior while trying to escape their plastic reality by climbing out of it. This experience was accompanied by a painful sensation akin to being torn apart into subatomic particles.

After approximately 15 minutes, the effects began to wear off gradually, leaving the participant with a renewed sense of perspective on life and existence."
1012,115979,"During the second trip, the participant experienced vivid hallucinations after inhaling a larger dose of the substance. Initially, they perceived an open door as an infinitely recurring portal through which they were falling. This led to a scene where they imagined themselves as the sun overlooking a green pasture with cows and a fence.

The participant then observed pixels in the environment come to life, forming strips that peeled away from the scene towards them while saying goodbye to each other. These pixel entities appeared happy and excited about their departure. The participant also experienced physical sensations of melting into surfaces they were touching.

Later in the trip, the participant imagined themselves as a cow within the pasture scene. They fell off the bed during this experience but remained safe. As the effects wore off, the participant slowly sobered up and regained awareness of their surroundings."
1013,66235,"The participant smoked a substance along with marijuana in a water pipe at a friend's house. Initially, they felt the world splitting open and experienced difficulty sitting up, eventually falling onto a bed. During this time, they requested silence from their friends. The participant reported an out-of-body experience where they observed themselves but felt something was wrong.

They then returned to their body feeling extreme pain and made a continuous 'OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH' sound for some time without responding to others. Upon regaining partial awareness, the participant saw one friend on the phone, another laughing, and a third expressing discomfort with the situation.

The participant stood up and walked into the living room where they inquired about what had happened. Friends mentioned that someone (likely the participant) had urinated themselves during the experience, though this was not true for the participant. The participant became agitated and punched one friend before calming down. They then smoked more marijuana to change their mood."
1014,66679,"The participant reports using the substance at various strengths over several months, primarily for exercise motivation and body awareness. At lower doses, they experience closed-eye visuals focused on bodily functions and perceive their body as a highly capable machine with 360-degree movement. They describe feeling more athletic and acrobatic.

At higher doses, they encounter visual hallucinations of aliens, reptiles, dragons, and other entities. These beings sometimes communicate with the participant, encouraging them to delve deeper into the experience. The user also mentions a sense that there is another dimension or world beyond their physical body, which aligns with their religious beliefs.

The substance reportedly enhances bodily awareness, allowing the participant to feel every part of their body more intensely, including individual hairs and eye movements. It also seems to balance brain hemispheres and improve overall body symmetry."
1015,66606,"The individual began their experience by smoking a bowl of a potent extract. As they held the smoke in for 30 seconds, they felt intense pressure building up inside their body, similar to being cranked up a hill on a roller coaster. This sensation was followed by vertigo-like symptoms that quickly subsided.

Opening their eyes, the participant found themselves in downtown San Francisco, surrounded by neon lights and billboards. They noticed a clock floating at the end of an alleyway and saw a couch in the middle of a street with their friend sitting on it. The realization that they were still in their apartment and not actually in San Francisco hit them suddenly, causing laughter.

During this experience, the participant's inner monologue became prominent, providing commentary on their surroundings and actions. They attempted to explain the trip to their friend but found words difficult to form. As the effects began to wear off, the participant laughed at having mistaken Christmas lights for city signs. The comedown was described as pleasant, similar to feeling stoned after peaking on mushrooms.

The entire experience lasted only a few minutes but felt much longer due to its intensity."
1016,115807,"The participant inhaled a substance and experienced an intense alteration of consciousness. They felt their body merge with the bed and exit like a zipper opening. This led to an awareness of multiple realities co-existing simultaneously, represented by an expanding black and blue bubble filled with a flowing grid symbolizing time. Two distinct entities appeared on either side: a male and female guardian-like figure, both taller and grander than the participant, with pale gray faces and longer, more angular features. These entities were smiling gently at the participant, who felt protected and amused by their presence.

The participant communicated with these entities, asking how this experience was possible. The male entity conveyed an idea that allowed the participant to interact with both realities. By pressing their consciousness against the reality bubble, they could see into it as if through a window, observing their bedroom from outside. They also experimented with interacting through other senses, such as speaking and touching.

The participant then communicated with their wife, who was present as a trip sitter. The wife responded verbally, and the participant reached out to take her hand. As they began explaining the experience, the altered state started to fade, and the black and blue reality fractured and disappeared."
1017,34302,"The individual began their experience in a positive mood after meditation. They smoked a substance, leading to an intense alteration of consciousness. In this altered state, they found themselves in a bright, rippled plain with no discernible landmarks or purpose for their body. The person felt puzzled and attempted to return but encountered difficulty. After several minutes, they sensed the presence of other entities but did not interact with them. Eventually, the individual slowly returned to reality, feeling awe at the experience. They noted that re-integrating into normal consciousness took about 10-15 minutes."
1018,41223,"The participant began their experience by ingesting a mild dose of the substance through chewing leaves for 10-15 minutes. This was followed by inhaling vaporized form of the substance, which produced more pronounced effects. The setting was a dark bedroom with ambient music playing in the background. 

Initially, there were minor visual and calming sensations experienced while the participant's mind began to drift away from reality. As the effects intensified, the participant reported becoming 'stuck' on the right side of their computer screen, where they were viewing animated patterns generated by the music visualization software. The experience was described as immersive, with the participant feeling like they became part of these visualizations.

During this time, the participant lost awareness of their physical surroundings and bodily sensations, such as a foot that remained elevated without conscious control. The effects lasted approximately 30 minutes, peaking around 10 minutes after inhalation. 

The experience concluded with the participant gradually returning to reality, noticing their previously forgotten position and surroundings."
1019,11824,"The participant smoked an extract from a plant and experienced intense effects almost immediately. They felt powerful forces pulling them to the ground and were dragged into a vehicle by several beings. These beings transported the individual to another plane of existence where they encountered their ""true family,"" consisting of four or five massive entities. The participant was scolded for meddling in human affairs.

In this new environment, the participant saw all human beings they had ever encountered, perfectly detailed and small enough to be held in one hand. They felt a profound sense of belonging with these entities and lost any previous identity as a human. As the experience began to fade, the individual returned to their familiar world but perceived it as a parody lacking true depth.

Upon returning home, the participant experienced an intense blinding yellow light behind their eyes while descending stairs. This was followed by frantic attempts to regain a sense of reality through physical comfort and sensory stimulation. The overall effect was described as creating a new reality with its own history, erasing the previous existence entirely."
1020,95384,"The participant met a friend at a quiet park at midnight for a drug experience involving an unknown substance in powdered form. They vaporized about 5 pinches of the powder, experiencing a quick onset of euphoria and well-being after three hits. Physical sensations included limbs feeling like ""jelly"" and difficulty standing steadily. The peak of the trip brought on talkativeness, introspection, and vivid sensory experiences such as rich feelings from the stomach area and an enhanced sense of touch and smell.

The participant described their body as feeling made of silk with a thick cream-like layer covering it. They felt extremely empathetic towards their friend and experienced fluid movements while listening to music. The odor of sassafras oil on their wrist became sweet and beautiful, and smells were perceived in multiple dimensions.

After about an hour, they attempted to ""nomad flip"" the experience with salvia divinorum but had difficulty smoking it due to coughing fits. They experienced mild hallucinations that extended for about an hour after the initial effects of the first substance wore off. Visuals included dark purple and green oil spill patterns, bright white circular patterns, and brief hallucinations such as shadows turning into people and a real-looking cat appearing and disappearing.

The walk home in the foggy night was eerie with faces and figures appearing in alleyways and shadows. The participant fell asleep easily and woke up feeling an empathetic, relaxed afterglow with lingering sensory perceptions of the initial substance's smell on their skin."
1021,104298,"The participant began by feeling an overwhelming sense of remembrance and recognition, which was accompanied by a thought loop repeating ""Hello Salvia."" They felt as though they were in a moment of time where everything had been remembered but then forgotten again. The mind felt overloaded with information, yet this state seemed familiar.

Physical sensations included pressure on the left cheek, similar to leaning against an invisible surface, and a misalignment between perceived gravity and actual physical orientation. This sensation subsided when the participant shifted perspective slightly, which also broke the thought loop.

The participant noticed heat from a cannabis joint they were holding but had difficulty releasing it due to muscle control issues. When they managed to let go of the joint, it appeared to shift on a plane perpendicular to the ground rather than falling as expected.

Visual perceptions included an overwhelming sense that any viewpoint was equally valid and beautiful, with a particular fondness for their current location. The participant felt this place represented what they had chosen to forget and cherished deeply.

Gradually, normal perspective and muscle control returned without noticeable changes in the environment. The experience concluded with the realization that the friend present did not partake due to cannabis tolerance issues, and the participant left feeling content to return home to their wife."
1022,53727,"The participant took an extract of a substance from a bong with four friends. Within 20-30 seconds, they felt tingling around their back and neck, increased body temperature, and sweating. Their perception of reality distorted; the room appeared to be stretching and compressing into a portal-like shape, with physical boundaries pulsating. The participant lost their sense of self, feeling that their face was melting and identifying as part of a 'melt-collective.' They curled up in a fetal position on the bed while experiencing brief terror at the breakdown of reality. A non-tripping friend mocked them, to which they responded by expressing pity for not being part of the melt-collective. The trip ended linearly with residual body sensations."
1023,41595,"The participant consumed an extract and immediately entered into a vivid hallucinatory state. They saw yellow walls, ceilings, and floors in what appeared to be a large, rolling machine. The participant felt intense pressure each time the machine rolled over them, causing temporary blackouts. Initially believing they were part of this mechanical structure, the participant later rebelled against it, experiencing severe physical discomfort as if being stabbed by knives. After struggling to escape, they briefly returned to their car but were pulled back into the hallucination before finally emerging. Upon returning to reality, the participant felt relief but experienced lingering effects such as tingling sensations and rapid eye movements."
1024,50554,"Five friends consumed brownies with cannabis in the morning and later smoked salvia 10x extract. The narrator experienced a pulling sensation, visual distortions, and an imbalance in their head's perceived weight. They laughed uncontrollably and fell to the floor, remaining there for about five minutes before regaining control. During this time, they felt as if their body was waving through water like a flag on a stick. After approximately 5-7 minutes, the effects began to wear off, allowing them to stand up and rejoin their friends."
1025,61720,"The individual wakes up experiencing vivid hallucinations of shapes and colors before regaining some clarity about their situation. They are unsure who they are or where they are and ask others for an explanation. One person provides vague details about entering the room through a door. The participant then recalls that they were in someone's house, having used a substance with others. After inhaling deeply twice from a makeshift pipe, they experience a sudden onset of intense effects, followed by a return to normalcy shortly after. They feel confused and ask to watch television to ground themselves. The experience is described as brief but impactful, leaving the participant feeling slightly silly and tired afterward."
1026,46263,"The individual began their experience by smoking a substance through a homemade water bong outside in near darkness. They reported feeling an immediate effect characterized by heightened sensory perception, particularly of air and wind sounds, as well as visual narrowing to only the center of their normal range. A pressure sensation was felt pushing from the front right side, affecting movement.

After about five minutes, they used a stronger form of the substance in a single inhalation. Reality seemed to dissolve, replaced by swirling colors that eventually formed into objects and patterns, including two men sawing a tree with a double-handled saw. The individual also observed themselves sitting still in a chair. They were unable to move their body except for their eyes.

A man appeared in another chair and spoke clearly: ""Hi there. It's been a long time hasn't it? I haven't seen you in a while."" He chuckled and turned his attention back to the men sawing the tree. The experience lasted several minutes before colors began swirling again, accompanied by feelings of happiness and contentment.

Mobility returned after about five minutes, and within 15-40 minutes, the effects had mostly worn off, leaving the individual feeling normal again."
1027,114984,"The participant begins by sitting in a patio with a bong filled with salvia. After inhaling deeply, they enter a white room where two entities resembling humans or fractal geometry are present. These entities communicate with the participant, repeating phrases such as ""the experience of everything"" and asking about the word ""katúm,"" which the participant utters without knowing its meaning. A horizontal line appears in the room, acting as a portal to the patio outside.

The participant is transported back and forth through this portal multiple times while their body undergoes changes. They describe their body becoming thin like paper and being covered by an enigmatic vine-like substance. The entities continue to repeat phrases about the nature of the experience. Eventually, the participant returns to the patio where they find the bong filled with dirt. They clean themselves up and return home."
1028,110986,"The participant took a dose of salvia while sitting on a couch with family and friends during sunset. As the effects came on, they felt extremely intense visuals without hallucinations. Their perception of size, depth, and colors became altered. They detached from their body and surroundings, observing everything through an alien lens. Time seemed distorted, feeling like an eternity despite only being about 5 minutes.

The participant's father and a friend were present but the participant felt increasingly detached from them. The visuals included bright colors and a cubie, staircase pattern. As they came down slowly over the next 20 minutes, their partner cuddled with them to help ground them. They had a flashback two days later which helped clarify some aspects of the experience."
1029,110743,"The individual began by inhaling a substance through a homemade bong, after which they experienced initial dizziness but maintained some control. They then laid down and felt as if they had consumed marijuana rather than the stronger substance they expected. As the effects intensified, they noticed a previously unseen archway in their room.

Suddenly aware of an altered spatial orientation, where what was once considered ""up"" became forward, and there was no floor beneath them, the individual found themselves observing a body from above. They questioned whether jumping back into the brain would return them to normalcy but chose to remain in this state for further exploration.

Surrounded by non-physical entities described as consciousnesses, the participant engaged in contemplation about the nature of reality and identity. These entities communicated with the individual, though their words were not fully comprehended. The experience was characterized by a mix of amazement, fear, and enjoyment.

After approximately four minutes, the individual attempted to return to their body but initially struggled with movement. They eventually re-entered their physical form, feeling wobbly and disoriented as they sat up and drank from a soda bottle beside them."
1030,12177,"The participant began by smoking a small amount of substance in a homemade bong. They felt an immediate onset of effects, characterized by a loss of control over their body movements, which they described as slow-motion or synchronized with their heartbeat. This sensation persisted during the journey from the bathroom to the bed.

Upon lying down, the participant struggled to regain control of their body and eventually succeeded after verbalizing that they had control. They then experienced a revelation about the simplicity of bodily functions and felt watched by an unknown presence above them. The participant described this moment as intense and transformative.

After regaining full control, the participant got up and walked to their computer, where they played an online game with improved coordination. Throughout the experience, there were no reported visual hallucinations or encounters with other entities."
1031,69253,"The individual began by lying down on their bed and soon experienced a visual hallucination where they saw an infinite series of their own bodies stretching upwards from their feet to their face. This led to confusion about which body was theirs, as each appeared different. The participant then sat up and spoke to themselves and the shirt hanging over their bed, expressing that it was just them, the shirt, and the desk.

Next, they hallucinated complete blackness, thinking they had gone blind before regaining sight. They saw a version of themselves in a desert, extremely skinny, which made them feel very hungry. The participant then listened to music on their iPod while lying down, experiencing an auditory hallucination where their ""thinking voice"" told them they were lucky to be sane.

They laughed uncontrollably for an extended period and later returned to seeing the infinite versions of themselves on the mattress and springs. They felt the water travel through every part of their body when drinking a glass of water from the desk. After cleaning the pipe, they reflected on being fortunate to be in good mental health and living in a country with abundant food.

The experience concluded with mild lingering effects such as memory and time distortion, along with pleasant physical sensations while lying down."
1032,36489,"The participant began by smoking an extract of an unnamed substance using a bong. They felt immediate effects after the first hit, including a sensation of something pulling on the back of their head. After several hits, they experienced a loss of control over their body and surroundings. The couch appeared to transform into a giant ribbon, and the participant felt as though they were flowing off the couch and into the air.

Small rabbit-like creatures emerged from the couch and ran around the room. A woman's voice was heard calling to the participant, inviting them to join her. As the experience began to fade, the participant returned to reality but still felt slightly altered for about 10-15 minutes afterward."
1033,21810,"The participant began by smoking dried leaves from a pipe and experienced immediate effects. They observed a dog-like entity covered in a shining net of energy and noticed similar phenomena around their hands. This led to a transition into another world where they were in a forest near a wooden fence, engaged in what felt like magical lessons involving the creation of an energy net.

Returning to the original world, the participant reported a strong sense of déjà vu and an overwhelming feeling that this magical state was their natural way of life. The experience left them with a lasting impression of beauty and magic permeating everything around them. Upon waking up in the morning, they felt rested and experienced an afterglow for several days.

In a subsequent session, the participant again felt a pulsating sensation in their chest and re-entered the magical realm. They expressed frustration at returning to a ""normal"" state, finding it less natural than the Salvia-induced experience. The overall effect was a renewed sense of purpose in pursuing a life filled with magic and beauty."
1034,12063,"The participant smoked a substance with friends J and S. After taking three hits, they fell into a state of intense dizziness and disorientation. They found themselves in a space filled with giant turning gears, where they were someone else, delirious and unaware of the drug use. The participant encountered strange creatures resembling Alf from an old TV show but without snouts, which gave them a Bert and Ernie vibe. These creatures were identified as J and S, who were referred to as ""fridolphas."" The participant felt uncomfortable around these entities and yelled at them.

The participant then became aware of a presence on the wall behind them, described as having a wise native person's vibe. This presence was associated with ambient music from their radio and was identified as the substance itself. Physical sensations included sweaty hands and feet and an itchy feeling on the body. The participant wanted to get away from J and S due to discomfort.

The experience concluded with the realization that being alone in a room would be better for such trips, though having sitters outside is recommended."
1035,74334,"The participant had two experiences with an unnamed substance. The first experience took place in a lounge setting where they smoked about .75 grams through a hookah. They felt lightheaded and then entered a state of intense visual hallucinations, losing all sense of reality. During this period, they encountered multi-colored obstacles and crevices but could not recall specific details beyond these general impressions. Upon returning to consciousness, they found themselves in the lounge with a green glass hookah and had disoriented thoughts about being at the beach.

The second experience occurred at home using a corncob pipe with approximately .25 grams of the substance. They felt an unusual sensation as if someone was tugging on their eyelids, which served as a warning not to proceed further. This triggered vivid recollections of the first trip, including tearing down curtains leading to different realities and encountering astonished people who revealed hidden truths. The participant then regained consciousness with dissociative thoughts and a headache."
1036,75178,"The participant began by smoking a substance, experiencing initial auditory hallucinations before feeling as though they were sinking through the floor. Their body felt brittle and solid like wood while the lower half was being peeled away from reality. They perceived people behind them but were too terrified to turn around, fearing permanent separation from the physical world.

Above them (in front), they saw a white house with a circular window, which they recognized as their childhood home across the street. This image served as an anchor to the physical world. The participant felt a strong urge to hold on and not let go, despite the comforting presence of unseen entities behind them who were urging them to turn around.

After what seemed like an extended period but was actually only four to five minutes, the participant returned to the physical world gradually, experiencing relief yet lingering discomfort. They sat in a fetal position for some time before standing up and feeling a wave of prickly heat followed by sweating. The experience left them with a sense of well-being and changed perspective."
1037,97988,"The individual began their experience by ingesting a substance through smoking. After about 5 seconds, they experienced intense pressure starting from the feet and spreading throughout the body, culminating in a rotational sensation that left them upside down. They found themselves in a familiar pink/orange/yellow space with four yellow walls and an open ceiling. A strong sense of familiarity and recognition accompanied this environment.

In this setting, the participant heard someone calling out to them from below. They were held by one leg and pulled into a horizontal position facing downwards. There was a single female entity present in one corner of the room who appeared familiar. Another being, whose identity was not recognized, continued to hold their leg and pull them towards the female.

The individual decided to return to reality while maintaining clarity of consciousness. They opened their eyes briefly but then closed them again as they were dragged further into the dense mass that separated this altered state from reality. The sensation of passing through a dense border was felt intensely on the head, with the last words heard being ""Won't you come?"" As more of their body passed through the barrier, they returned to their living room and quickly documented the experience while details were still vivid.

Upon reflection, the participant noted similarities between this trip and previous ones, feeling more familiar and comfortable with the transition process. They interpreted these experiences as potential illusions occurring in the brain, possibly linked to early memories or birth impressions, rather than proof of alternate realities or afterlife phenomena."
1038,97987,"The user had three experiences involving physical sensations and visual hallucinations. In the first experience, they felt hot fingers pulling them down through a solid surface into another realm. They experienced a sensation of passing through the floor's atoms and being folded or flipped while in an altered state characterized by pink and orange colors.

In the second trip, similar sensations occurred but were less intense. The user saw waves of pink/orange visuals when their eyes were closed and could hear real-world sounds, which were disturbing at times. They opened their eyes a couple of times to see normal surroundings before returning to the altered state.

The third experience involved interactions with female entities described as middle-aged women in a yellow-walled space. The user felt these beings touching them, carrying them, and inviting them somewhere through an opening on one of the walls, which led to what seemed like a bath area. During this trip, the user could hear music and real-world sounds but briefly experienced disappointment that it was all an illusion.

The user returned to reality by passing through another solid surface, feeling fear and exertion during the transition. They regained full control within minutes after each experience but found the overall impression confusing and unsatisfying, quickly forgetting most details except those interrupted by real-world sounds or eye openings."
1039,114864,"The participant prepared for their experience by setting up in a comfortable outdoor environment on a sunny day. They used a bong to inhale approximately 1/7th of a gram of salvia extract. Initially, there were no immediate effects, but after repeating the process, they began to feel the substance's impact. Auditory hallucinations occurred, including what was described as a ""spirit"" singing in an unfamiliar yet familiar language. The participant experienced visual distortions, such as the sky appearing divided into two sections with converging cloud formations creating vortices.

The participant communicated with the perceived spirit of salvia, asking if they could pose a question. Salvia responded by posing a question back to the participant, indicating that it sets its own rules for interaction. The experience was described as playful and mischievous but enjoyable when the participant respected the spirit's norms."
1040,103879,"The participant began by smoking a small amount of a substance in the evening, experiencing mild tingling and body flush. They then smoked another small amount later that night before attempting to vaporize some more but failing due to equipment issues. Finally, they smoked one pinch of the substance around 12:30 AM.

Upon inhaling deeply, the participant immediately felt intense effects, losing awareness of their physical surroundings and self. They experienced vivid visuals of bright flashing lights against a dark background, feeling as though their consciousness was transcending into another realm. The visuals were described as moving and transforming rapidly, with colors like blue, yellow, red, and grey forming patterns that seemed to move in synchronization with music.

The participant felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility for the fate of the universe, believing they had to make crucial decisions about its future. This led to intense fear and a feeling of being overwhelmed by the power and significance of their perceived role. They attempted to regain control but eventually realized the experience was likely contained within their mind.

As the intensity decreased, rational thoughts returned, allowing the participant to question whether the experience could truly affect the outside world or if it was merely an internal phenomenon. This realization helped alleviate some fear and allowed for a more reflective state as the effects wore off.

The participant called a friend around 1:30 AM to share their experience, speaking rapidly due to excitement and residual effects. They continued reading about related concepts until 4 AM before sleeping. The next day, they felt altered perception while driving and ordered books on consciousness and reality. Two weeks later, the experience still influenced their thoughts and perspective."
1041,89069,"The participant began by trying a small dose of the substance, experiencing mild disorientation but no significant effects. They then tried a moderate dose and felt uncontrollable laughter for several minutes before settling into a pleasurable high followed by disorientation. For the highest dose, they were transported to an orange grove with about 20 people picking oranges. The room appeared to rotate on its side, flinging them into this new environment. Upon returning to their dorm room, the orange pickers remained and gathered in a corner while observing the participant. They managed to stay in both realities briefly before reluctantly letting go and merging back into one reality. In the dorm room, most of the orange pickers left through an open door (which was actually closed). The trip lasted about two minutes as recorded on video, showing the participant laughing uncontrollably and looking around aimlessly. Afterward, they felt extremely disoriented for an hour before feeling normal again."
1042,73901,"The participant began experiencing effects shortly after consuming the substance. They saw rotating faces and legs, which formed a fan-like structure that moved around their field of vision. This was followed by being inside a cube where they saw more faces and legs in every direction. The participant heard their grandmother's voice asking about the day, to which they responded ""Tuesday."" 

The experience then shifted to what felt like a train station within their room, with dark corners representing tunnels and trains leading to different places. They identified a Native American Indian on a passenger car window as their guide and boarded an airplane made of mud in space. Inside the airplane, they saw a tribe of Native Americans and heard their music. The chief told them ""It's time,"" and pushed them out of the plane, causing them to fall back into reality.

Upon landing, the participant found themselves on their bed with their girlfriend. They tried to communicate but struggled, eventually managing only unintelligible sounds. After sitting down and drinking water, they noticed changes in their surroundings before finally snapping out of the experience."
1043,50822,"The participant began their drug trip alone at home after inhaling the substance. They experienced initial throat irritation but soon found themselves in a hallucination where they were drawn up and above an enormous house-sized leaf that was phosphorescent with glowing orange veins. On this leaf, there was a house with a familiar knitted 'Welcome' mat leading inside. Inside the house, two young men and an older woman greeted the participant. The woman seemed to recognize the participant and chided them for waiting so long to return home. The participant felt as though Salvia was speaking directly to them. They apologized profusely upon exiting this vision, expressing a sense of missing these people despite never having met them in real life."
1044,11643,"Four friends gathered at a house to experiment with an extract of Salvia divinorum. The narrator and one friend (D) started by smoking small doses around 130mg, then increased to about 200mg each. As the effects set in, they experienced visual distortions such as warped room perception and separation of objects into distinct planes. The narrator felt a strong urge to isolate from noise and had intense thoughts about destroying another person (G) who was present, which his friend D also shared. They continued smoking more extract but did not achieve stronger effects. After the peak experience, they smoked additional doses but found no significant increase in intensity. The overall experience was enjoyable but felt somewhat weak compared to expectations."
1045,11593,"The individual experienced intense body sensations upon consuming the substance, including a pulling sensation that felt like external vibrations moving through their body. Their boyfriend's face appeared distorted, resembling a Picasso painting with different colors. The participant perceived small humanoid figures similar to Oompa Loompas from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" They believed this alternate reality was their true home and felt they were working on a project with these entities for a higher purpose.

The scenery resembled bright green rolling hills like in early Nintendo games, and trains with faces passed by continuously. These trains included one with the participant's boyfriend's face. The experience lasted approximately four minutes during which the individual was unconscious but vocalized confusion about their surroundings. Upon returning to reality, they felt sober and amazed at the experience.

In a subsequent use, the wall appeared to open up, revealing an Oompa Loompa waiting to guide them into the same alternate reality as before."
1046,103742,"The participant smoked a small amount of an extract with another person using a bong. After inhaling, they immediately noticed a stronger taste compared to previous experiences. They laid down due to dizziness and then experienced a loss of control over their body and senses. Vision became distorted into giant moving chevrons, making it difficult to see anything clearly except for their friend's face which appeared repeatedly in the pattern.

The participant tried to speak but found themselves repeating 'no, no, no' continuously. They felt trapped in a moment, unable to move or think clearly. There were brief moments of clarity where they saw their legs and managed to communicate that something strong was happening. During these clearer moments, they held onto their friend's hand for comfort.

The experience ended suddenly with the participant regaining control over their body, vision, speech, and understanding. They felt relief and reflected on the intensity of the experience, realizing the importance of living each moment well."
1047,99467,"The participant prepared for the session by mixing 4 dropper-loads (3ml) of a green tincture with water, then placing it under their tongue. They experienced nervousness before the onset but managed to calm down with medication. After about 10 minutes, they felt a warm, twisty sensation spreading from their mouth into their body. The music seemed to engulf their head and continue past them, creating a dizzy feeling.

With eyes open, the participant's field of vision appeared choppy, shifting dramatically between frames. They experienced nostalgic feelings, transported back to when they were 20 years old, with excitement and anticipation about secret activities in a small room with candles burning. After about 45 minutes, the effects started to subside.

The participant's wife then took Salvia through a pipe and had an experience where she felt like her deceased sister was present, leading to fragmented speech and laughter."
1048,73660,"The individual begins by consuming a psychoactive substance from fresh leaves, leading to a disorienting and disembodied state. Lying down, they feel lifted away from physical consciousness into an awakened dream-state. The sensations of their body become heightened, including temperature, air flow, blood circulation, and heartbeat. Despite knowing that bodily functions remain normal, the individual experiences fear as they realize the need for control over their life is challenged.

The experience becomes less intense than previous occasions, but the participant's will falters, pulling them back into their ego. They reflect on how humans seek distraction or control to avoid facing mortality and loss. Time seems condensed into a single moment, with the individual fully present in the now, confronting their own mortality and fear of loss.

The participant calls for family members, including their wife and daughter, who join them. Despite outward calmness, they ask their wife to check their pulse, confirming bodily stability. The beauty of their family is noted, but it also brings up unwillingness to face loss and death. They observe the workings of their mind as abstract rituals, realizing that thoughts can influence reality.

The individual identifies more with their mind than body, fearing lack of control over emotions and appearance. This leads to a realization about seeking dominance over thoughts, which is seen as absurd when confronted directly. The experience expands back into normal time perception, leaving the participant with a clear and uncluttered mind for several hours, feeling at one with their emotions and environment."
1049,72850,"The participant inhaled an unspecified substance twice, experiencing physical sensations including torso contraction and body heat/vibration during the first inhalation. Upon the second inhalation, with eyes closed, they entered a vivid hallucinatory state characterized by fractal patterns that seemed three-dimensional. An entity appeared, described as having rose petal-like features peeling off her form and a voice morphed from the music being played. This entity was perceived as familiar but alien, resembling a childhood figure such as a first-grade teacher or the mother of the Berenstain Bears, though distinctly different in appearance with small nubs or protrusions on her head. The encounter with this entity was described as pleasant and marked by laughter and excitement."
1050,89223,"The individual prepared for the experience by doing sun salutations and breathing exercises. They smoked one hit of a substance through a bong and immediately felt detached from their body and surroundings. They found themselves in an unfamiliar place where they no longer existed as a human but were instead something insignificant, like a thread in reality's fabric.

The participant experienced physical sensations such as feeling their body like matchbox cars and having difficulty moving or speaking due to the substance's effects. They felt disoriented and had mild open-eye visuals for some time after the experience. The individual was unconscious for about one minute during which they muttered and twitched slightly.

After regaining consciousness, the participant expressed fear and confusion but gradually returned to normal sensations within half an hour. They walked home feeling shaken by the experience and called friends to discuss it. The next day, they felt rung out as if attending a funeral and were initially scared to try the substance again but later felt open to revisiting the experience with a more accepting attitude."
1051,84779,"The experience began in a dimly lit dorm room with calm music playing. The participant felt peaceful after reading Psalm 23 and smoking a small amount of substance. As the effects set in, the room transformed into a dark jungle with a greenish area that stood out from the darkness. A sense of a female presence was noted, along with the feeling of being watched by an unseen creature.

After inhaling more concentrated substance, visual hallucinations intensified. The participant saw red sheets rippling and white light surrounding them while their friend held a bong. They felt disconnected from reality but still able to move around. Closing their eyes led to seeing flowers that turned into rabbits, with the sensation of becoming part of these visions.

The experience became more intense, leading to confusion about identity and surroundings. The participant was aware of needing to breathe due to heavy clothing, which grounded them slightly. They described a state where reality was shattered but remained conscious of their need for air.

After approximately ten minutes, the participant's friend spoke, bringing them back to reality gradually. They experienced lingering closed-eye visuals before falling asleep, feeling close to a full-blown psychedelic experience had it not been for physical discomfort from clothing."
1052,63597,"The narrator and two friends visited a friend's house after smoking marijuana. Upon arrival, they were greeted by the host's grandmother before entering his room, which was decorated with posters and lava lamps. The host provided a small amount of an unknown substance for B to try first. After taking a hit, B laughed uncontrollably, rolled around on the bed, and screamed ""weeee!"" He later described the experience as a roller-coaster ride.

Next, it was the narrator's turn. They inhaled deeply and immediately noticed their friends being sucked away into the distance while the room stretched rapidly. The narrator fell backward into what they called ""salvia world,"" where everything had an irrational texture similar to ""The Beatles: Yellow Submarine."" They felt detached from reality, unable to think clearly due to overwhelming information. The landscape appeared as a rotating 3D pop-up book made of dirt and stone.

Feeling scared for their life and believing they were dead or dying, the narrator eventually returned to their body, lying on the bed dazed with an unbearable fear. They could not communicate effectively, only muttering ""world"" when shown a globe by B. The marijuana high was diminished after the experience. G then took his turn, describing it as scary and always the same but mentioning there was a lesson learned each time.

The narrator felt trapped in the room, with everything seeming fake and reality appearing unreal. They smoked more marijuana to calm down before leaving. The feeling of ""nothing is real"" persisted throughout the night."
1053,83334,"A group of friends gathered at a fire pit to try salvia for the first time. They took turns smoking from a bong. The narrator's first hits produced laughter and a sensation of being made of glass, which quickly subsided. After taking larger doses, he experienced visual distortions such as compressed vision and rotating images. He saw a giant staircase leading into fire below him, felt terrified, and had the sensation of being made of stone with difficulty speaking. As the effects wore off, his skin felt sensitive and itchy.

One friend who took 15x extract after the narrator experienced extreme fear. This friend ran away, lost a sandal, and later described seeing malevolent entities that wanted to hurt him."
1054,81336,"The individual began by smoking a small amount of a substance from a pipe. They noticed the heat and taste briefly before feeling the onset of effects very quickly after their first toke. During the experience, they saw a large-boned blonde woman leaning out of a white house with an American flag nearby. Towards the end, there was a sensation of reality being peeled away, including parts of New Jersey and their face.

Upon regaining awareness, the person felt fragmented memories of family members but was unsure of their relationships to them. They were on their back porch, feeling as if it were part of a cocoon in space before realizing they were outside attached to their house. The lighter and substance packet were still clutched in their hand, causing concern about hiding them.

They heard a repeated phrase with a rhyme, fitting into the thrumming rhythm associated with the aftereffects. Within five to ten minutes, normalcy returned but left them feeling awestruck. In a subsequent attempt, the come-up was faster and less intense, accompanied by visualizations of a marching band led by a girl in a pleated skirt and bare knees, approaching the person sprawled on their porch."
1055,98711,"The participant began by taking a small dose of an unnamed substance and experienced a disintegration of reality. They saw a line of people folding over, giving up their realities, and realized that this was happening to everyone except themselves. Voices above discussed the situation, expressing pity for the participant's reluctance to give up their false reality. The participant felt sadness at realizing that connections and loved ones never truly existed.

The experience continued with the participant crawling outside, having unlocked multiple doors without awareness. They were found by a neighbor who helped them return to reality after about 40 minutes. During this time, the participant oscillated between accepting the facade of reality and acknowledging their newly discovered knowledge. The experience left the participant with an appreciation for life and a sense of happiness."
1056,49395,"The participant prepared their room with dim lighting before consuming two 'pinches' of an extract. After inhaling, they experienced visual distortions including spinning and spiraling surroundings. The room morphed into a hallway shape that split in half, revealing stars and lights. Cartoonish characters of mixed colors appeared and one began laughing like a child. An older male voice joined with the child's laughter to call out ""come fly with us!"" A beautiful singing voice was also heard, which the participant perceived as possibly divine or a spirit within the substance.

The vision shifted into a tunnel of colors following the singing voice, after which the participant felt a connection to their body again. Upon returning to their room, they noticed that posters and pictures on the walls seemed to come alive and peer out at them. Attempting to move caused them to fall to the floor where they lay watching the room contort around them until clarity returned.

The singing voice persisted throughout the experience but vanished once the participant realized they had stopped tripping."
1057,52463,"The participant experienced an intense trip after consuming two doses of an unnamed substance. Initially, they felt heavy and dissociated but maintained some awareness. After holding in the smoke for 15 seconds on the second hit, their ""observing ego"" disappeared completely. They reported feeling as though they no longer existed and were submerged in a new reality. The world appeared to blend into itself with reddish colors, and they felt extremely scared, more so than during their first day in prison.

As the experience peaked, the participant's body seemed to divide into multiple parts that became part of their surroundings. They described being in a space where everything was blended together, including themselves. Upon coming down from the peak, they saw their face in a mirror and were unable to scream due to fear. Their ""observing ego"" slowly returned, but they still felt disconnected from reality.

The participant experienced auditory sensations as their brain reconnected with sound. They clenched a bowl in their hand and hid it out of paranoia. As consciousness returned, they became fidgety and shook their arms violently, though this did not alleviate the effects. The aftereffects were strong, causing them to feel tired but also scared that the experience might recur if they lay down.

The setting was described as less than ideal, with the participant's mother away for lunch. They emphasized the importance of being around trusted individuals during such experiences and recommended tying oneself down or having someone nearby to ensure safety."
1058,72190,"The participant smoked a small bowl of a substance mixed with Salvia leaf and experienced an immediate onset of effects after about two minutes. Initially, they were pulled into a dark realm filled with light auras forming entities. A female voice communicated that these entities had been waiting for them specifically. The individual felt connected to their right leg by what appeared as a pulsating chain with undecipherable writings.

They attempted to leave the house but encountered difficulty turning in certain directions, particularly to the right. Upon reaching the outside, they conversed briefly with their friend who was standing nearby before returning inside. The entire experience lasted approximately 10 minutes of intense effects, followed by a lingering dazed state for about an hour."
1059,96618,"A 50-year-old male consumed salvia for the first time in decades, starting with a lower dose (10x) which produced repetitive patterns of familiar objects in a waxy plastic-like appearance. He then tried a higher dose (20x), experiencing intense discomfort from smoke inhalation and burning lungs. This led him to take a shower where his body felt achy while he soaped up. His voice sounded raspy and monstrous when speaking with his wife, though she did not seem to notice the change. The experience concluded with a feeling of unusual clarity and sharpness."
1060,72442,"The individual began by preparing for the experience in a controlled environment, ensuring they were alone with no distractions. After consuming a small amount of an unknown substance, they immediately felt a slight buzz followed by intense visual hallucinations that expanded to 3D on their TV screen. They experienced a complete disconnect from reality, feeling like they had been transported to another dimension and questioning who they were and where they were.

The participant struggled with speech, producing song lyrics instead of coherent words when attempting to communicate. They tried standing up but found everything distorted as if melted and stretched. The visuals remained vivid even as the intensity began to subside. At one point, they attempted to go outside but decided against it due to a neighbor's noise and their own discomfort.

As the experience progressed, the participant felt increasingly panicky but managed to calm themselves by recognizing the short duration of the effects. They continued to experience numbness in their hands and face for nearly an hour after the initial consumption."
1061,64622,"The participant and their friend prepared for a psychedelic journey using salvia extract. They found a comfortable location behind Joe's shed to sit during the experience. After inhaling the substance, the individual felt intense physical sensations, including their body curling into itself with jerking motions. They entered a vivid hallucinatory state, experiencing various images such as an American flag being burned, scenes from movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and abstract designs of swirling colors and patterns. The experience was characterized by time distortion, with only 5 minutes passing subjectively feeling much longer. The participant communicated incoherently during the trip, repeating phrases like ""Mikes Head Production."""
1062,106583,"The participant prepared for the session by creating a conducive atmosphere with sage smoke and music. Upon inhalation, they experienced an immediate presence that began a thorough examination of their surroundings and life history. This process included a visual scan from right to left, upwards, and then downwards. The dog in the room reacted suddenly when the scanning reached it.

The experience revealed aspects of the participant's spiritual biography, emphasizing their journey as a ""cosmonaut"" with multiple homes. They were praised for their interest in psycho-spiritual matters but also reprimanded for not fully utilizing their voice to represent themselves and their strengths. This was followed by an overwhelming affirmation of consciousness.

During the latter part of the experience, the participant felt the presence of powerful, wise beings standing behind them, interpreted as a Holy Family of guides. They expressed reverence and awe, eventually dancing around the room with a sense of cosmic mystery and wonder."
1063,112808,"The participant describes their first experience with Salvia, which began mildly but intensified after taking a larger dose. During the intense phase, they felt an overwhelming sense of freedom and clarity, allowing them to express themselves more openly than usual. They perceived others as part of a shared dimension rather than separate individuals. The participant also experienced visual phenomena such as ethereal streams connecting people when one person gestured to another. The music playing in the background enhanced their experience, contributing to a celebratory atmosphere. After about 5 minutes, the high began to fade, and they gradually returned to their usual state of consciousness."
1064,112898,"The participant smoked an unnamed substance twice in one session. During the second attempt, they experienced vivid visual and auditory hallucinations. They found themselves in a large dome-like structure with a circular ring or arch above them containing slits of light. Voices from all directions rapidly guessed combinations of two words or names, progressing through an alphabetical sequence. The participant felt aware and conscious throughout the experience, even when their body was seemingly turned inside out into different materials such as chain link fence, paper, wood, basketball/orange, water, and grass/plant matter."
1065,71680,"The participant began their experience by smoking a large dose of an extract in a bong while listening to music. Initially, they felt a familiar fuzzy vibration but then experienced disorientation as if being pulled into a waterbed. They found themselves standing across the room with no memory of how they got there.

The room appeared unfamiliar and disturbed, with missing items and wetness on their body. Seeking safety, they ran to the kitchen, turning on lights despite bright daylight outside. The world felt tilted sideways, and they had difficulty perceiving time accurately. They attempted to call others but received no responses.

Feeling an urge to smoke marijuana for comfort, they returned to their room, where they discovered a mess: leftover substance on the floor, a knocked-over bong, spilled beer cans, and a ripped closet door. These events were not remembered by the participant, who felt controlled by dementia and the substance's power.

The experience lasted approximately 15 minutes before these observations were made."
1066,88577,"The individual smoked an unknown substance using a glass pipe. After inhaling, they felt tingling sensations in their head and the room began to spin uncontrollably. They fell backward onto the bed and experienced intense visual hallucinations of swirling colors and shapes that transformed into green vines resembling a double helix or vortex. There was pain in their right hand, which later turned out to be from holding a hot lighter.

The participant felt paralyzed and struggled to sit up straight on the bed, experiencing overwhelming fear and panic. The music playing intensified these feelings. After about 15 minutes, the intensity began to subside slightly, allowing them to remember what they had consumed and regain some control. It took approximately 30-40 minutes for the effects to fully diminish."
1067,11366,"The participant had three experiences with a psychoactive substance. In the first experience, they felt that the car's metal was swallowing them and the seat cushion felt strange. Their mind felt dulled throughout the experience. The second experience involved lying in bed where everything felt strange for a while, and there was some ego loss when looking at objects like the comforter. However, the mind remained clouded, making introspection difficult. In the third experience, which used an extract form of the substance, the participant felt as though the bed swallowed them into a faerie's cave but also experienced uncomfortable tactile sensations from the sheets and beads of sweat on their back. The mind was again clouded, preventing any interesting thoughts."
1068,112294,"The participant listened to music and experienced heightened sensory perception and paranoid delusions, believing the lyrics were directed at them personally. They communicated with an uncle via text message, feeling intense anger and indignation. In a garage setting, they had vivid hallucinations including seeing an enormous maroon octopus tentacle and being scrubbed clean of soul filth by a parental force. The participant also experienced identity confusion, believing themselves to be named Waldo and questioning their true identity. They interacted with the twins' mother who took on a teacher-like role, confiscating their pipe and expressing concern for their well-being. The experience concluded with reflections on personal identity and relationships."
1069,10775,"The individual attempted to use a substance multiple times before experiencing notable effects alone at home. During the experience, they felt intense shaking and visual distortions. The room appeared torn like paper in their field of vision, creating a split reality effect where two versions of the same space existed simultaneously. They perceived this as having an additional sense of vision and audition, with one side representing the altered state and the other the normal state.

The participant engaged in actions such as tearing their face apart without realizing it was not physically happening. This led to confusion about what was real during the experience. The trip lasted for a period before they returned to normalcy, taking two hours to realize that some of the events were hallucinations."
1070,67375,"The individual began their experience by inhaling a substance through a glass pipe. They felt an immediate onset of effects, experiencing a sense of floating above themselves while remaining calm despite initial fear. The participant reported feeling separated from their body, yet able to communicate clearly with themselves in this altered state.

Music played a significant role in the experience, becoming more than just auditory; it was perceived as a stream of life that could be seen, felt, smelled, and breathed. The individual engaged in playful activities such as moving objects around and changing positions on the couch while testing their ability to remember these actions upon returning to their body.

As the effects began to wane, the participant found they had control over whether to remain in the altered state or return to their physical body. They made a final attempt to prolong the experience by smoking the remaining substance, which allowed them another brief journey before fully returning home.

During this time, the individual reflected on life and existence, feeling as though they were in a different dimension that was welcoming yet devoid of other beings. The experience was described as beautiful and peaceful, with a sense of understanding about the brevity of human life and the possibility of continuing in another form or dimension.

Upon returning to their physical body, the participant felt a peaceful tranquility and a smile at the memory of the surreal journey."
1071,56314,"The participant experienced a brief but intense period of altered perception after smoking a potent substance. They perceived horizontal parallel lines formed by objects in the room, such as friends' shoulders, a sofa back, and a windowsill. Music became arrhythmic and difficult to process. The environment felt dreamlike and unreal, with the sense that life had turned into a game controlled by others.

The participant's phone rang, but they perceived it as part of an ongoing hallucination. They attempted to communicate with others in the room, who seemed to want them to touch their mouth or type ""please don't make me touch my mouth."" The individual sat on a wall, feeling detached from reality and unable to determine the time.

After leaving the room, they lay down on a couch and changed the music to something more familiar. As others left for cigarettes, the participant remained in the room until the effects subsided after less than five minutes."
1072,14267,"The participant experienced a brief hallucination after inhaling smoke from an unknown substance. During this period, they perceived themselves to be outside looking at what appeared to be terraced houses, with trapezoid shapes (later identified as road markings) and fence posts (viewed through the bus poles). They felt pushed around by a force, which was later recognized as the vibrations of the bus. The hallucination lasted approximately five minutes and was associated with sitting in a familiar seat on a regular bus route."
1073,42637,"The participant consumed an unspecified substance in a dorm room with a friend at around 2:00 PM. After inhaling a large dose through a bong, they experienced a pulsing sensation in their lungs and chest. They felt confused and scared, standing up suddenly and noticing a distorted sound from the fan.

They asked their friend to leave the room and climbed under the covers, closing their eyes. In this state, they perceived themselves as being on a shelf in a store, looking down at two people: one a cashier and another reaching for items. They felt like a newspaper and were then sucked back into reality. Opening their eyes, they saw their room again but still felt strange.

After relaxing for some time, the participant got up to share their experience with friends. The overall feeling was described as an incredible afterglow, leaving them in a very positive state."
1074,11349,"The individual prepared for their experience in a controlled environment, dimming lights and playing soft music. They took one hit of the substance through a bong and immediately felt an intense rush. This was accompanied by a strong physical sensation as if a weight was pushing down on them, making it difficult to stand up straight. The disorientation lasted for some time after the initial hit.

The participant observed that their pupils would expand significantly and then recede in waves, similar to the ebb and flow of tides. They also noted perspiration in their hands lasting over 45 minutes. Overall, they found the experience exciting but acknowledged it could be frightening due to its rapid onset compared to other psychedelics.

No interaction with any entities was reported during this trip."
1075,28100,"The narrator and four others tried a substance for the first time in a dorm room. S took the initial hit and experienced altered perceptions, lying down to giggle while questioning their identity. Next, the narrator inhaled two hits but began coughing on the second inhalation, initiating the experience. The room appeared distorted with exaggerated proportions and angular faces of those present. Christmas lights created jagged edges around the room, and there was a fusion of loud noise from fans and the sensation of jagged walls. Physical pain occurred in the forearms and legs as if resisting an external force.

On the second attempt, the narrator experienced similar but more coherent sensations. After lying down due to intense pain, they noticed part of a blanket resembling a face. Upon sitting up, T was seen with faces appearing on every crease of curtains and parts of his clothing. Closing eyes revealed rapid-moving images of copied faces accompanied by flashing lights and colors.

The experience concluded with the narrator feeling groggy but planning future attempts in different settings to avoid pain."
1076,111926,"The participant began their experience feeling disconnected from reality and lost self-awareness shortly after inhaling the substance. They perceived time as non-existent and saw a multifaceted being composed of family members, described as a prism-like entity with a glitchy, cartoony appearance. Upon coming down, they felt an appreciation for this reality, recognizing beauty in separation and distinction. The experience led to gratitude for unique aspects of their current dimension, such as the ability to hold and drink water."
1077,84870,"The participant began their experience by inhaling a small amount of substance. They immediately felt its effects while still holding their breath. In their visual field, they saw what appeared to be a light brown pottery bowl or vase. An entity, described as very old and wise, communicated with the participant about the bowl being composed of fragments that corresponded to spaces for people present in the experience.

The entity indicated there were only enough spaces for all but one person, similar to a game of musical chairs. The other individuals quickly took their places within or around the bowl. The entity conveyed that everyone was part of the whole and could not exist as an individual outside of it. As the participant tried to join, they realized there was only one remaining space.

This realization frightened them because they understood they might be excluded from existence if they did not secure a spot in the bowl. Overwhelmed by fear, the participant abruptly ended their experience by running downstairs and breaking out of the trip state."
1078,111469,"The participant prepared for their experience by cleaning their room and meditating. They then began taking small hits of the substance, experiencing a sensation of their body being separated and revolved at different speeds and distances. After an hour, they took a larger hit and felt disconnected from time and place, focusing solely on a lantern above their bed.

The lantern transformed into two entities made of metal wiring and paper, which began to dance and spin across the ceiling. These beings were described as alive but indifferent or at peace with existence. The participant communicated telepathically with these entities, asking if their mother was present. The entities confirmed that she was not there.

At this point, a hand made of indigo and violet hues reached into another dimension, resembling the participant's mother. The participant recognized it as her mother but understood that she existed in a different reality. After thanking the spinning wire beings for their time, the participant returned to sobriety and reflected on the experience, concluding that they needed to live their life with love and honor their mother."
1079,111734,"Three individuals took a substance together, with each experiencing different hallucinations and sensations. The first person saw goblins that turned into tree stumps when they realized he was seeing them. The second individual had visions of being on train tracks surrounded by chanting beings that became menacing, leading to a red vision before returning to reality. The narrator felt trapped in a repetitive pattern and an alternate reality where their previous life seemed like an illusion. They experienced physical discomfort, including heat and difficulty moving, and confusion about their surroundings. After the trip, the narrator felt detached from their usual worries and relationships but gradually reconnected with them over time."
1080,50505,"The participant reported experiencing intense visual and physical effects after consuming an unspecified psychoactive substance. About 10 seconds after the second hit, they began laughing uncontrollably and fell over. Their friend observed that they were drooling heavily and making strange hand motions while uttering childlike laughter and gibberish.

During the experience, the participant saw themselves trapped inside a large box with an unusual color and texture, similar to a plastic blue lunchbox. Inside this box was a creature described as having a shape resembling a cross between a bowling pin and a slice of pie. The creature's yellow color was unique and hard to describe. As the participant moved closer to the creature, they felt as though they were passing through it like a curtain, experiencing tactile sensations similar to cotton or liquid.

The experience seemed to repeat itself with identical creatures appearing in front of them each time they passed through one. This cycle continued for an extended period. The participant had no coherent connection to their surroundings and could not communicate effectively with their friend, who reported only hearing gibberish and observing the drooling and strange behavior.

Overall, the experience was intense but enjoyable for the participant, though it may be too overwhelming for others."
1081,22023,"The participant consumed a potent extract and felt an overwhelming sensation shortly after several hits. They became trapped in a bizarre time loop where their actions were immediately replayed before them as if on a delay or instant replay. This made it difficult to distinguish between actual action and mental replay, causing fear and confusion. The experience was highly intense and disorienting, leading to severe dissociation from reality."
1082,111730,"The participant smoked an unknown substance for the first time in a dorm room setting. They initially experienced a slight sideways sensation but did not feel any effects until they took a deeper inhalation and blacked out. Upon regaining consciousness, they found themselves in an alternate reality with a green sky and barren tan hills. In this world, they perceived themselves as either a dragon or a shoe and were hosting a children's show. A conductor appeared and instructed them to return to the real world through a tear in the sky. When they stood up, they returned to their physical body but felt disoriented and anxious, seeing their legs stretched out infinitely with a zippered floor revealing the alternate universe below. The experience lasted about 5 minutes before fading into a tired, drunk feeling."
1083,111568,"The participant smoked a large dose of an extract in their backyard with their girlfriend. They experienced immediate brightening colors that intensified until everything was white. In this white room, they encountered a malevolent human-like entity wearing a lab coat who spoke about societal manipulation and showed them a machine for observation. The entity then took the participant to a black object made of people stuck in their own gravity. After feeling trapped in this object, the participant experienced strange sensations including clicking noises that intensified into uncontrollable laughter.

Returning to physical awareness while still seeing white, the participant laughed an eerie mechanical laugh and slowly regained vision with each click, revealing a clay-like animated world around them. They felt terrified and emotionally agitated, retreating inside their room where they remained in emotional agony. The girlfriend reported observing the participant sitting blankly, muttering about stores, staring off into the distance, then laughing strangely before eventually feeling better by the next day."
1084,10790,"The participant began their experience by smoking an extract of a psychoactive substance in a wooded area near a pond. Initially, they felt effects similar to LSD, with objects like plants and rocks appearing lively and visuals flashing rather than pulsing. They experienced a ""pull and push"" feeling that turned into being pulled in a constant direction.

Closing their eyes, the participant hallucinated being at a beach with palm trees, waves, and sand. Upon opening their eyes, they found themselves still in the woods but perceived it as an altered reality. A spinning vortex appeared about 10 feet in front of them. The experience lasted approximately 20 minutes before subsiding.

Afterwards, the participant felt tired, confused, and experienced some memory loss. They noticed a compass indicated the ""pulling"" sensation was coming from the east rather than north as expected. About an hour later, they drove back home feeling fairly sleepy but awake and sober completely after three hours."
1085,24586,"The participant smoked a substance and began experiencing vivid visuals almost immediately. Five golden figures resembling Aztec statues appeared on the wall, interviewing the participant. The environment then shifted to a grass field where three friends were in caves, staring at the participant. The participant felt as if they too were in a cave and noticed their friends' legs protruding like popsicle sticks. They tried to communicate but received no response and realized they had transformed into a popsicle themselves.

The participant's body then moved uncontrollably towards the back door despite attempts to stop it, feeling as though they were being pulled by an external force. They eventually woke up in another room, experiencing more visuals under a blanket before returning to normalcy. Friends reported that during this time, the participant's voice became low and mumbled, suddenly saying ""popsicles"" and jumping up to spin towards the back door."
1086,25079,"At 1:45 pm, the individual began experiencing effects after taking two large hits of an unknown substance. Initially standing at a table in their bedroom, they noticed their vision tripled. As the experience progressed, they entered a state of confusion and chaos, forgetting their identity and surroundings. They felt connected to the wall and experienced sideways vision, attempting to escape from something undefined.

After what seemed like a long time, they managed to open the door and leave the room, feeling liberated but quickly overwhelmed by multiplying rooms and further confusion. Despite this, they maintained balance enough to walk without falling over. Around 2:00 pm, reality started to return all at once, bringing back memories of the experience.

For about forty-five minutes after coming down, the individual was still shaken, trying to process what had happened. Observers noted that during the peak of the experience, half of their body appeared paralyzed and speech was slurred, resembling a stroke or seizure."
1087,63243,"The participant smoked an unknown substance and experienced visual distortions where objects appeared both larger and smaller simultaneously. They felt a sense of physical lightness and heaviness. Closing their eyes revealed a woman unraveling their legs, which were perceived as roots, to form a path. The woman spoke about the participant's future, emphasizing learning and success. As she mentioned specific people, quick visions of these individuals appeared. The environment became brighter with more vivid green colors."
1088,76309,"The individual was at a friend's house for a smoking session when they reluctantly agreed to try an unknown substance after encouragement from another friend. They took a large hit and immediately felt apprehension throughout their body. The next thing remembered was melting into another world where two other beings were present, though their appearance is not described in detail.

In this altered state, the participant experienced a sensation of being part of a complex process moving slowly, like the tire tread on pavement. They heard voices repeating ""And this moment can't be part of the next moment,"" and felt as if they were being squeezed through a tiny hole repeatedly. The experience was described as excruciatingly slow.

Upon returning to reality, the participant found their hand hitting the wall and continued to feel intense effects. They perceived the room as an attic with a dim lightbulb and tunnel vision, unable to look left of it. Strange patterns were also observed. During this time, they spoke about a ""zipper world"" and tried to convince themselves that everything was ending.

The friends in the room reported that immediately after lying down, the participant began screaming at a high pitch, thrashing around, and needed to be restrained by one friend sitting on their legs while another covered their mouth. This lasted for five minutes before the individual calmed down and continued talking about the zipper world."
1089,51814,"The individual reported initial feelings of disorientation and difficulty in performing tasks such as rolling a cigarette. They perceived objects like paper and tobacco moving around playfully, attributing this to a feminine entity's interaction. When attempting to stand or move, the environment felt unstable, similar to being on a moving vehicle.

Visuals were described as animated patterns and designs with nature-oriented themes, including leaves, flowers, and elf faces. The experience was likened to a fairground journey through reality's inner workings. The participant felt integrated into these visuals rather than an observer.

A significant entity appeared as a Queen who showed hospitality and guided the individual through various visual experiences. No ill effects were reported post-experience; instead, the person felt well-being and satisfaction."
1090,45308,"The participant experienced a short-lived altered state where their desk morphed into a person leaning over as if performing the function of a desk. Objects on the desk, such as coke cans and a monitor, came to life and took on roles within this human-desk entity's ""life."" The cans were cleaning, while the monitor displayed vital statistics. A calm female voice commented that everyone is like this, implying that inanimate objects transforming into living entities and back again is normal."
1091,48389,"The participant smoked a small amount of the substance in a hookah and felt warmth around their eyes and temporal lobes, with everything appearing warm and distinct. They noticed slight perspiration around their armpits, lower back, and sides of the head. The driveway appeared clean and two-dimensional to them.

Aftereffects wore off partially, but they smoked again with a roommate. The roommate experienced confusion briefly before lying down on a futon. The participant laughed manically in a corner against a dresser. The roommate reported feeling heavy legs and seeing flashing colors.

The participant heard an engine revving internally while laughing intensely. They then went to the kitchen, laughing at the lights for several minutes. Aftereffects subsided, allowing them to walk normally again and put on music. They walked outside with heightened sensory perception of colors and textures."
1092,70768,"The participant smoked a large dose of an unnamed substance and immediately felt the world fold inward towards a central point of view made up of colors and textures from the room. They experienced intense, non-painful sensations throughout their body that they described as ""energy knives."" The participant felt disconnected from their own body and believed everything had collected within themselves.

During this experience, the participant heard someone's thoughts aloud, which included comments about the trip being crazy and observing the visual effects. This led to a belief that their previous life was imagined and that they were traveling through different planes of existence in the form of a zipper.

The participant then started to ""unzip,"" with colors spinning into their vision as if being reassigned to their proper spots. They felt intense sensations similar to being split open but not painful, followed by a sensation of being torn apart and put back together again. The experience concluded with the participant zipping up again and recognizing people in the room.

Afterwards, they sat still for about 10 seconds before returning to normal, covered in cold sweat. They felt like a million bucks after lying down on the floor with friends."
1093,78421,"The individual started by inhaling the substance and immediately felt prickly sensations across their body, similar to weak nettle stings. They then entered a two-dimensional world where they were with friends who had always known them. In this realm, they experienced profound joy and a sense of belonging to something beyond human comprehension.

Next, the individual was transported to a 1930s beach scene, complete with striped costumes, pointy mustaches, and joyful children playing. This experience felt like it lasted an extended period.

Suddenly, the individual began to fall, feeling constricted and terrified as they were being pulled back into their physical reality. Upon opening their eyes, they saw themselves as a man in a room on Earth, which was jarring after experiencing such freedom from ego and fear in the previous realms.

The experience left the individual with an understanding of what total amnesia might feel like, suggesting that the alternate realities felt closer to true reality due to their lack of physical constraints and reliance on pure thought."
1094,49884,"The participant began their experience in a room with friends at a wake. They smoked a full bowl of an extract from a mini bong. Initially, they felt no effect but then suddenly perceived themselves falling backward and the ceiling spinning. This led to a sensation of reality shifting into a continuous spinning line around an axis, accompanied by other lines spinning alongside them. The participant attempted to escape this spinning but found it impossible.

They ran downstairs and encountered a friend outside who called their name. The participant told her she was also spinning before remembering they had taken the substance. They returned inside, where sounds intensified the spinning sensation. After some time, the spinning subsided, and the participant felt more comfortable, as if gravity was less oppressive."
1095,81837,"In a basement setting, five people gathered for an evening activity involving the consumption of an unknown substance by three participants. One person experienced disconnection from reality and difficulty with spatial relations. Another participant reported vivid closed-eye hallucinations of a colorful alternate world with friends and family present.

The narrator perceived cartoonish animals dancing around their unfinished drink, accompanied by a cat performing a soft-shoe routine before grooming itself. The narrator expressed irritation when the cat stopped dancing and verbally lashed out at it. A sober observer mentioned seeing a garden hose earlier that day, which caused laughter among some participants.

A hideous chicken with an extremely long neck briefly appeared, startling everyone present. The narrator became agitated upon its disappearance and questioned the observer about its whereabouts. After calming down, the narrator experienced a hallucination of floating through a tunnel-like river in a boat, emitting beautiful purple and orange lights.

The group later laughed about the chicken incident, with the sober standby suggesting it might have been her arm reaching out to prevent spilling a drink."
1096,53041,"Two friends took an unspecified drug using a homemade bong in a park at night. Sire experienced intense laughter after inhaling the smoke, followed by a sensation of his face becoming loose and drooling. He then saw pink surroundings resembling cotton candy roads with huge pink castles on either side, from which candy was being tossed out. He perceived his friend's face repeating ""candy castles"" on every castle.

Nayra initially had difficulty speaking and laughing but in her second experience, she laughed uncontrollably and ran around the park. She saw a dimension door opening with a troll emerging from it and friendly abstract creatures behind her. When Nayra closed her eyes, she perceived a zipper moving upwards when leaning back and downwards when looking down. The right side of the zipper disappeared, revealing countless shelves that opened and closed."
1097,55826,"The experience began at 0:53 with confusion and distortion of spatial relationships, time, and emotion. At 1:02, paresthesia was felt on the left side of the face and head, along with distortions in sense of equilibrium. By 1:17, there was an increased sensation of hearing, paresthesia throughout the body, internal awareness, and difficulty processing visual stimuli logically. The peak experience occurred at 1:29, characterized by spatial and impressional hallucinations, mild dissociation, amplification of childhood memories, psychedelic effects such as visual processing of sensations, continued paresthesia and emotional distortions, laughter, radical changes in perception, altered executive function, and anxiety.

From 3:36 onwards, there was a decline in the experience with increasing logical thought processing and comprehension. The participant noted that anxiety decreased with the awareness that the effects were short-lived. By 3:52, noticeable decline occurred, leading to a linear decrease of effects and return to normal functions by 6:30."
1098,111180,"The individual experienced two sessions with a substance. In the first session, they held in about 1/5 gram of the lower potency substance for 30 seconds. They felt an octagonal shape spinning around them and saw a white wall pressing against them. Voices behind the wall asked 'WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS'. The experience was intense but not frightening.

In the second session, they used a higher potency substance with a sitter present. After inhaling a larger amount and holding it for 30 seconds, they blacked out briefly. Upon regaining consciousness, they saw red and black rolling pins approaching them in a cartoon-like manner. They felt extremely small compared to their sitter, who appeared as an enormous caricature of himself. The participant experienced intense feelings of grief, horror, and being trapped, believing they were the sitter's plaything. After about a minute, the sitter asked if they were okay, which provided some comfort and helped them return from the distressing experience."
1099,102999,"At 7:30 pm, the individual prepared a tea using one rounded tablespoon of dried leaves simmered for ten minutes. They chewed the cooked leaves before sipping the tea slowly. By 8:00 pm, they experienced closed-eye visuals with abstract geometric shapes in ghostly pastel colors. While reading a novel, the letters on the page appeared three-dimensional and hovered above the paper. The wood-paneled floor patterns seemed raised and luminous, eventually melting into glowing maple syrup-like substance.

At 8:15 pm, the individual walked to the living room where their wife was sitting at the computer. Their voice sounded small and distant initially but returned to normal after a few minutes. The house felt like it was rocking back and forth, requiring concentration for walking. Visual lines bent and swayed, and there were kinesthetic sensations of being pushed or leaned on in various places.

By 8:30 pm, the floor patterns in the bedroom had stopped moving and glowing. At 9:00 pm, they ate supper and prepared for bed as the trip concluded. The aftereffects included insomnia lasting three hours with disturbed sleep throughout the night, slight thirst, exhaustion from minimal sleep, but no headache."
1100,100231,"During the initial experience, the participant felt disoriented and uncomfortable with their eyes open, leading them to close their eyes. They then perceived a 3D lattice-like structure emerging from their forehead, which pulsated slightly and rotated slowly. The lattice had an appearance of being made of wax and plastic, and it seemed intelligent, possibly laughing. At each intersection of the lattice were small eyes. This vision dominated the experience while the participant's eyes were closed.

In subsequent experiences, a 3D wall of familiar objects appeared instead of the lattice structure. These objects included everyday items like phones, cups, and pencils, which made the participant feel claustrophobic and bored. The smoke was hot and caused coughing during all sessions, with increasing discomfort noted in later trips due to the heat."
1101,50515,"The participant inhaled a substance and experienced immediate visual and auditory hallucinations. Upon inhalation, they heard a vibrating sound similar to a UFO landing and saw a red spiraling gateway opening two meters away, about 1.5 meters wide. Two small figures dressed in medieval attire were present on either side of the gateway. The participant took another inhalation and felt the room begin to turn with the spiral motion, which then enveloped them. They experienced an unpleasant scraping sensation as the red light spiraled over their body from feet upwards. This sensation was described as a purging process that left them feeling clear and renewed after the first experience but became more uncomfortable in subsequent sessions, where they felt like a small figure on a road being rolled over by a bow-top caravan driven by the small beings. Each session peaked within one minute of onset and lasted 5 to 10 minutes, with full return to normalcy occurring around 20 minutes after the experience."
1102,88779,"The participant inhaled an unknown substance and experienced almost immediate visual distortions, including moving edges on surfaces that resembled cupcakes. The room turned completely white, and the participant saw their friend as extremely small, about a centimeter tall. A black scribble appeared, destroying everything in its path, causing intense pain on the right side of the head. The participant entered what seemed like a classroom with school desks, a blackboard, and a teacher's cart. They were asked questions but could not respond coherently, eventually shouting ""No tits"" repeatedly when someone misinterpreted their speech. A second appearance of the scribble brought them back to reality, where they noticed their friend staring at them. The experience was brief, lasting about five minutes, but felt much longer."
1103,76130,"The participant took multiple hits from a bong containing a substance mixed with weed. They experienced difficulty holding in large amounts of smoke initially but managed longer inhalations later. While lying on a couch, they felt like a clock, experiencing internal sensations related to time and movement. The participant's body felt centered around a clock-like object, with waves and motion shifting every second it ticked. This allowed for simple movements. They also experienced mild closed-eye visuals, seeing basic outlines of objects in the room such as the couch, desk, and TV. Friends gathered around noticed changes in behavior and reported that the participant repeatedly mentioned feeling like a clock."
1104,110969,"The participant began the experience feeling that the effects were mild but quickly realized they were entering a profound altered state. With eyes closed, they perceived reality as if it was being sliced into multiple dimensions or time periods. They felt their consciousness being pulled away from their physical body in a direction that seemed to defy gravity.

During this process, the participant encountered an entity described as a nurturing presence, similar to feeling one's mother nearby but more powerful and all-encompassing. This entity appeared to represent a higher form of reality or existence.

The experience included moments where the participant felt detached from their physical body, perceiving it as just one aspect of infinite realities. They experienced a brief period of reduced anxiety and discomfort in their physical state while their consciousness was exploring this other realm.

After returning partially to their physical body, the participant noticed an enhanced awareness of gravity, feeling as if they were being pulled by the force of the Earth's rotation. This sensation lasted for several minutes before subsiding."
1105,110944,"The participant prepared a makeshift bong to smoke approximately 1 gram of Salvia divinorum but found the effects barely noticeable. They then rolled a joint with the same amount, holding the smoke for about 20 seconds before exhaling. During this time, they felt three distinct presences: one motherly and caring, and two childlike. These presences evoked a sense of nostalgia and past memories. The participant's surroundings appeared blurry and shaky when they opened their eyes to look for the dropped joint. They realized that these presences were manifestations of themselves in different roles—motherly and as children. About an hour later, they found the partially smoked joint but felt satisfied with the experience."
1106,62544,"The participant smoked an unspecified substance and began to feel sweaty and heavy almost immediately after inhalation. They experienced visual distortions and felt as though they were being watched, even though no one was present in the room. At around 30 seconds into the experience, the individual entered what they described as an ""IMMATERIAL existence."" In this state, they encountered colorful beings shaped like flames, which represented different colors such as yellow, blue, and red. These entities communicated with the participant, explaining that their previous reality was a fabrication for those too dumb to see the truth.

The yellow-colored beings informed the participant that they would become paint on behalf of the color yellow and be rolled onto a wall by a giant machine. The participant panicked at this prospect but was reassured by the colors that they would leave their body and join the new reality. After approximately four minutes, the individual regained some control over their senses and burst into laughter, feeling relieved to return to what they perceived as their original reality.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling light-headed, sweaty, and drooling after 6 minutes. They continued to feel a slight glow for another 20 minutes before returning to normalcy by the 35-minute mark."
1107,77466,"The individual attempted to consume the substance via smoking but only experienced minor perceptual changes and felt off-balance, similar to being drunk. They then tried rectal administration using gel caps with estimated low doses, resulting in mild perceptual alterations akin to a small cannabis hit, possibly placebo. A second attempt with a higher dose led to slightly more noticeable effects, including altered depth perception and increased sexual arousal. The third attempt with an even higher dose produced similar results but peaked after 15-20 minutes. Overall, rectal administration required larger doses for significant effects compared to other methods."
1108,91224,"The individual began by using half a leaf of the substance, experiencing only a slight feeling of lightheaded euphoria. Increasing the dose to a whole leaf intensified this sensation slightly. The strongest effect was achieved when they used an extract on top of tobacco in a pipe, leading to a rapid onset of intense visual and physical effects. For a brief period, the world dissolved into colorful stripes, and the individual felt as though they were melting out of their chair. Upon returning to normal consciousness, they reported feeling much more relaxed, with reduced muscle tension, anger, and depression.

The participant noted that while the experience was not particularly mystical, it significantly improved their mood and provided a sense of clarity and well-being. They expressed interest in using lower doses for future sessions to achieve a pleasant state without losing rationality."
1109,108829,"Four individuals went to a wooded area for a drug session using a shared substance. The narrator smoked a moderate-sized bowl of the substance and experienced an intense sensation of hurtling through space, feeling as if their spiritual body was detached from their physical form. They perceived themselves as a gold ring on an impossibly large finger and felt they had died, experiencing sorrow over leaving behind friends and unfulfilled goals.

The narrator then saw a human figure with infinitely thin cross-sections flaking off, each revealing organs and skeleton before falling away. These sections briefly formed conscious entities that would die when the distance became too great to sustain their existence. The narrator identified as one of these fleeting consciousnesses, reflecting on the cruelty of being given awareness only to die.

After coming back to reality, the narrator found themselves in a dark wooded area with friends and helped someone remove their glasses. During subsequent trips, the narrator experienced less vivid imagery but remained self-aware. In another trip, they saw an endless ring spinning rapidly with images of people on it, each holding hands like figures on a cross.

The narrator's friend beside them was panicking, believing she was a birthday cake. The last trip involved multiple curved line objects and uncomfortable sensations, leading the narrator to stop smoking for the night. As trips continued, they became less vivid and more self-aware."
1110,77082,"The participant initially tried a small dose of the substance, experiencing mild effects including a perception that the world folded into a 'V' shape before returning to normal. They then prepared for a larger dose with two friends present as a safety measure. Upon inhaling the larger dose, they felt the world fold again but this time it continued folding until their surroundings transformed into an abstract reality where their two friends merged into one entity forming a giant zipper behind which was reality. The participant attempted to stuff this new reality back into a box on the table, experiencing a sensation of being upside down and time rewinding as they did so. Reality then unfolded back into place, and the participant returned to normal consciousness with confusion about what had just happened. They found objects scattered around the room, including their keys, MP3 player, salvia, bubble-wrap, magazines, and doses. The experience was described as brief yet intense, followed by laughter and comments from friends."
1111,89838,"The individual began their experience late at night after taking some Kava Wave capsules earlier. They then consumed a gram of 40X extract from an excellent vendor. Initially, they felt a loosening of mind, a sense of non-localization in time and space, anxiety, and powerful bodily sensations.

They entered what they refer to as the Realm of the Shepherdess, a fluid world of light pixels populated by intelligent but evasive beings. They sensed that the Shepherdess was not in a friendly mood and might try to lure them into her world before striking at them while defenseless. Despite this warning, they initially allowed themselves to ""swim"" in the realm for about 10-15 minutes.

They then had two more hits of the substance, which led to strange thoughts that made them laugh repeatedly as they swayed energetically to music by Vas. As the effects continued, they saw a great fortress with its door closed and realized it was her personal domain. The Shepherdess invited them in but refused to show herself.

The participant considered accepting the invitation but then realized the vastness of her realm and their own finiteness, which could lead to getting lost there. They also reflected on wanting to try sobriety again and reconnect with God rather than becoming enthralled with this entity. After remaining indecisive for several minutes as the effects began to diminish, they declined the offer and returned to their body.

They sat swaying to music until they felt sober again before eventually using Salvia a few days later but then sobering up for about six months."
1112,92888,"The participant began feeling hyped up after purchasing a strong substance at a head shop. Upon returning home with two friends, they prepared and consumed one large hit through a pipe. Immediately, they felt immobilized as if gravity had intensified, and saw a blurry ball descending upon them like a roller coaster harness.

Panic set in when the participant tried to move but found their arm stuck to the couch. They then experienced several distinct hallucinations: first, being in their parents' living room; second, seeing themselves and billions of others standing in rows with feet buried in dirt, waiting for God to pluck them from earth; third, a floor made of skin flipping and flopping around; and fourth, geometric red and blue shapes surrounding them.

The experience lasted about 20 minutes, during which the participant felt detached from reality. Upon coming down, they experienced a headache and deep depression lasting up to three days due to the intense thoughts and visions encountered during the trip."
1113,76191,"The narrator and three friends decide to use an unknown substance together at a friend's house. The narrator administers the first dose to himself, experiencing intense physical sensations such as a ""ripping"" feeling in his body and a loss of speech. He sees his friends as abstract shapes with impossible colors and dimensions, recognizing them but also perceiving himself as one of these shapes. This leads to feelings of sorrow and existential dread.

The narrator's friend X then takes the substance, experiencing visual distortions described as ""frame vision."" Afterward, he feels a pain in his chest when seeing the narrator holding the substance but returns to near baseline quickly.

Friend Y takes a larger dose than the others, initially laughing uncontrollably. He then stands up and repeatedly slams his head into the floor while still laughing. When asked if he is okay, he expresses distress about the experience, blaming the narrator for making him do it. He curls up on the couch, complaining of foot pain and feeling out of control.

The narrator reflects that the substance should not be underestimated and that a bad mindset can worsen the experience."
1114,66419,"The participant inhaled a large amount of ground plant material through a bubler and experienced immediate effects. They felt as if being pulled into a tunnel and began laughing loudly. Visuals included patterns forming into shapes and recognizable figures such as family members and the sitter, all distorted and colorful. The colors then changed to yellow, and abstract Pacman-like entities appeared, walking in a circle around the participant.

The participant bonded with another entity that entered their experience, feeling extreme bliss and happiness through this connection. They described being between two worlds: one where they could interact with the sitter but still saw distorted visuals, and another deeper into the hallucinatory state. During the interworld phase, the participant laughed at a comment made by the sitter about cleaning the bubler.

The entity then pulled the participant back into the deeper experience, where they felt glowing yellow energy enter their heart before being pushed back to reality. The final stage of the trip was described as a high state of euphoria with some visual distortions but mostly grounded in reality."
1115,54119,"The participant consumed a substantial amount of an extract and began to feel subtle effects such as relaxation and slowed perception after inhaling it. As the effects intensified, they were suddenly pulled into a distorted world where everything seemed out of control. The environment appeared to spin rapidly, causing disorientation. Additionally, objects and people around them started splitting into millions of geometric planes, creating a fragmented visual experience.

The participant experienced physical pain and difficulty controlling their body movements. They mentioned seeing friends' bodies being torn into pieces and having trouble communicating due to the overwhelming hallucinations. The trip continued with an endless cycle of spinning and splitting visuals, resembling a giant machine in constant motion. Closing their eyes did not help as the visual disturbances persisted.

As the effects began to moderate, the participant moved around but still had no control over their body functions. They ended up in a chair about 6 feet away from where they started, unsure how they got there. The hallucinations were intense and difficult to describe, with friends' faces appearing distorted and moving independently on different planes.

The after-effects included a floating sensation and difficulty returning to sobriety quickly."
1116,57337,"The participant experienced visual distortions where the room appeared stretched and then transformed into a childhood memory of being trapped in a tesseract on a farm visited during a school field trip. They felt as if their entire life since that time had been lived inside this dimension and were trying to escape back to reality. The laughter heard was from other children who had tricked them into the tesseract, but they could not get out despite attempts.

The experience then shifted to hearing what sounded like an airport loudspeaker relaying information on a parent's couch before returning to reality with friends coalescing in front of them and the loudspeaker morphing into a TV commercial. The participant felt unnerved for the rest of the evening, questioning the reality of their surroundings.

Subsequent trips had similar themes but varied slightly. Physical sensations included involuntary arm movements during the return to reality, which caused damage to personal belongings like a bong."
1117,57973,"A 24-year-old female and her boyfriend, along with a friend named John, smoked an unknown substance in their living room during a snowstorm. John experienced mild effects characterized by mush-mouth, intense giggling, and stuttering. The boyfriend had a more severe reaction, becoming unable to move or speak for about five minutes.

The author then took a smaller dose and immediately felt waves of relaxation overtaking her body. She became immobilized, barely able to keep her eyes open, but managed to stay calm by focusing on deep breathing. As the effects intensified, she experienced vivid visual hallucinations where everything in her living room turned ""Simpson-esque,"" with lines and shapes becoming animated.

The author also perceived herself and others as being inside a television screen, specifically within Reverend Lovejoy's office from an episode of The Simpsons that was playing on TV. After about two to three minutes, the effects began to subside, and she regained control over her body while still feeling heavily intoxicated. She then moved into a more familiar high state, likely from marijuana use.

The experience lasted only briefly but left a strong impression, with the author laughing uncontrollably for several minutes before gradually returning to normalcy after a few hours."
1118,58450,"The participant experienced intense feelings of nihilism and existential despair during the trip. They perceived everything around them as a figment of imagination designed to distract from the true nature of themselves, which they felt was nothing. The experience involved a struggle against the perception of pointlessness and purposelessness in life. The participant described a scenario involving ""domino-like egos"" declaring their existence, which they fought against. There were no interactions with specific entities or beings mentioned."
1119,55682,"The experience began at a lake surrounded by pine trees. After smoking from a bong filled with salvia, the user immediately felt disoriented and blacked out for about a minute. Upon regaining consciousness, they found themselves in an altered state where everything appeared to have multiple layers, similar to a rolled-up newspaper. The user was terrified but managed to communicate with their friend.

The user attempted to sit down at a picnic table but lost control of their body, feeling as if they were one of the many layers inside it. They briefly saw themselves waving at their girlfriend from within their hand and experienced intense fear that this state would be permanent. Closing their eyes intensified the experience, causing them to perceive living inside various objects such as books and a fireplace mantle.

The user heard their friend trying to calm them down by explaining they were simply experiencing the effects of the substance. This helped them start talking again, though they found it difficult to explain what they saw. After about 15 minutes, the effects began to wear off slightly, but the user remained anxious and scared.

During this time, two deer appeared near the picnic table, which startled the user further. The group decided to return to their car, with the user leading the way despite feeling unsafe leaving the picnic table. Once inside the vehicle, the user felt safer but continued to feel strange effects for the rest of the night."
1120,55652,"The participant and their friend decided to use an unspecified substance while on their apartment's three-story porch/balcony. The participant felt mild effects initially, but when the friend prepared a larger dose, they went inside before the effects became too strong. However, the friend remained outside, leaning over the railing and showing signs of disorientation.

The participant tried to guide the friend inside but met resistance. The friend was unstable and nearly fell off the balcony, hitting his head on the door frame while attempting to enter the apartment. Despite this, he continued to lean towards the edge, seemingly entranced by the view below.

The participant pleaded with the friend to either sit down or go inside, but the friend repeatedly stood up and moved towards the railing again. The participant eventually managed to convince the friend to sit down temporarily before guiding him safely inside.

Once inside, the friend was confused and agitated, asking what had happened. He expressed concern about his head injury and wanted to see where he hit it, but the participant advised waiting until he sobered up. When fully sober, the friend described experiencing intense visuals and an out-of-body sensation during the trip, with no conscious control over his body."
1121,56948,"The narrator experienced spatial disorientation and light-induced visuals after inhaling a small amount of the substance from a glass pipe. During this first experience, they saw a woman emerge from the light, with her arms made of beams that wrapped around them, making them feel warm. The entity communicated telepathically, urging the narrator to stop typing on their computer and come with her.

In subsequent experiences at different locations, the narrator and others inhaled varying amounts of the substance through both glass pipes and a water pipe. Each person had distinct reactions:

- Person A: Experienced visual distortions and saw vines growing around objects and flowers appearing everywhere. They felt as if someone were trying to pull them into the floor and that they didn't belong there. They also perceived the presence of a woman similar to the one seen by the narrator.

- Person B: Lost touch with reality after inhaling deeply from the water pipe, looking at their hands and freezing in a guarded position on the couch for about 4 minutes before returning to normal.

- Person C: Had two experiences where they felt as if parts of their body were melting or being torn off. In one experience, they reported floating into space with limbs detaching, then falling into a field of grass surrounded by metal objects.

- Person D: Appeared anxious and confused during the experience but did not speak extensively about it.

- Person E: Initially enjoyed the effects from a glass pipe but became apprehensive after inhaling from the water pipe. They expressed discomfort and went to another room to regain composure.

- Person F: Also lost touch with reality but did not provide extensive details about their experience.

- Person G: Experienced two sessions, one enjoyable where everyone looked like cartoons, and another where they reverted to a primal state, waving arms violently and needing restraint. They could not recall the second experience clearly.

- Person H: Stated that they were becoming one with the couch but did not provide further details about their experience.

The narrator's final experience involved intense visual distortions, feeling as if they were an ancient plant in another world, and seeing a keyhole through which they glimpsed reality. The woman entity reappeared, urging them to stay in the other world and warning that those seen through the keyhole weren't real and wanted to hurt them."
1122,56480,"The participant decided to try the substance again after a previous frightening experience. They went to their friend's apartment in Kailua, Hawaii, where they prepared a bong for smoking. One of the friends smoked several bowls but did not feel any significant effects and eventually removed his shirt due to an uncomfortable sensation.

Afterwards, the participant took one hit from the bong and immediately felt themselves entering what they called ""salvia reality."" They experienced intense fear and began chanting about the substance being evil. The apartment appeared to be at the top of a skyscraper, and the friends were perceived as part of a conspiracy against them.

The participant also described an unusual physical sensation characterized by electric pulses moving through their body and solid black bars pushing into their vision from the sides. This was later attributed to a fan blowing on them. The trip lasted about five minutes, followed by another five minutes of discomfort before the effects wore off."
1123,55235,"The participant began their experience by consuming a significant amount of mushrooms but did not feel any effects until they took salvia divinorum later in the evening. Upon inhaling the salvia, they immediately felt intense physical sensations, including being pulled into what seemed like a vortex behind them. The room appeared to spin and shrink, with dark timber frames around the walls and ceiling giving it an old cottage-like appearance.

The participant then experienced visual distortions, such as star clusters in various colors, and had the impression that they were floating through space within their own room, which felt like another reality or plane belonging to some other entity. They did not feel threatened but rather invited into this new environment.

After a period of intense visuals and sensations, the participant attempted another hit of salvia while lying on the bed. This led to an episode where they were standing over their computer monitor, watching it melt downwards with a low-pitched drone accompanying the visual effects. They felt the presence of 3 or 4 entities guiding them through this experience.

The screen then formed an image of their house from across the street, with a black rectangular void emitting blue lightning bolts hovering over and through their home. The participant became confused and shouted before running to the door, unsure if these events were happening in reality or just in their mind.

Returning to the bed, they experienced melting into it as one entity, passing through a black void that turned brown and oozed goo around them. They felt entities trying to pull them deeper but asked if they could come up instead. Small brown creatures resembling alien babies appeared near their head, cackling evilly, while others lashed out from the darkness on their left side.

The participant eventually sat up in a state of slight confusion and continued to experience visual and sensory distortions even after returning to reality. They smoked a joint and contemplated what they had witnessed before falling asleep with these thoughts still rolling around in their head."
1124,54744,"The participant began by smoking Salvia divinorum in a makeshift bowl made from an apple. Initially, they felt only a mild buzz without any profound effects. After lying down in their darkened room and turning off the light, they experienced intense fear similar to childhood fears of monsters in the dark. Turning on the lights brought about a warm, happy, and free feeling.

They then engaged with their surroundings intensely, particularly focusing on Monet's paintings, feeling deeply connected to them emotionally as if experiencing the artist's emotions while painting. During this period, they noticed a feather on the ground which they stared at for almost a minute before it disappeared. They fetched a book and read part of it before making a phone call to a friend, expressing overwhelming feelings of love and importance towards their friendship.

The experience lasted approximately 45 minutes."
1125,77005,"Four individuals participated in a regular session involving the use of an unspecified substance in a sauna setting. During this session, they collectively experienced what they described as being ""sucked into another reality."" This shared experience was characterized by disorientation and a sense of entering a different realm. After returning from this altered state, one participant took another dose, which caused visible energy waves to emanate from their body. These waves affected the other participants, causing them to briefly enter intense states similar to those experienced earlier. The narrator describes having to let go of physical activities like dressing and simply ride out these energetic waves."
1126,55105,"The participant and a friend took turns consuming an unnamed substance extract. The friend experienced visual hallucinations involving someone named Bradley, whom they perceived as all-knowing. After taking three hits, the participant's thoughts and visions became unexplainable. They saw millions of different images of their leg, pipe, and lighter in various dimensions, wanting to escape each one. This lasted for about 30 seconds but felt much longer. The participant was laughing throughout and at one point yelled ""Let me out of here."" After the experience, they felt itchy and hot. Both participants found the trip too intense and uncomfortable."
1127,55071,"The participant experienced their first encounter with a psychoactive substance while sitting in a cushioned chair. Initially, there was no visual input but a profound sense of detachment from the body. The individual perceived themselves as an entirely non-physical consciousness, which caused fear due to the overwhelming nature of the experience.

Gradually, the participant became aware of stars and churning balls of light floating in what felt like an empty vacuum. They then experienced becoming the entire planet Earth, sensing everything on its surface simultaneously. This was too much for their mind to process, leading to further alarm.

The ego shrank again, and the individual perceived themselves as the house they were in, feeling everyone walking on them. Upon regaining some sense of self, they saw a figure resembling a giant stone building with an unusual shape covered in tie-dye (their shirt). The participant eventually returned partially to their body but still felt disconnected from reality.

Over the next half hour, the individual slowly reintegrated into normal consciousness and attempted to explain what had happened."
1128,45398,"The participant smoked a high-potency extract in a room with friends. After taking several hits, they experienced a rapid onset of effects where the world seemed to melt away, particularly noticing that objects such as their arm and the bowl became indistinguishable. When looking at their friends, everyone appeared two-dimensional, with one friend's mouth melting into the image of the room.

Closing their eyes led to hallucinations of a surreal environment similar to ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" In this world, an addict acquaintance was dressed in early 20th-century attire as a circus ringmaster. The setting included sanitized versions of street scenes where one could pretend to be a 'dirty junky' without actual dirtiness.

After about five to seven minutes, the participant returned to reality with their friends appearing cracked out and smiling (though they were just laughing). Upon asking ""Where the hell am I?"", the friend responded that he was right there. The experience concluded with a lingering itching sensation lasting another half an hour."
1129,45284,"The participant began their experience in a desert setting at night, using a bong to inhale the substance. They initially felt a body buzz and a sense of separation from reality, accompanied by a realization that our reality is one channel among many on an infinite TV set. A voice, possibly their own or another's, encouraged them to let go and not worry.

After the initial effects wore off slightly, they took a second dose, experiencing a stronger sensation of pulsing throughout their body. They felt layers of themselves, including worries and concerns, falling away as if suits were being removed. This was described as walking through a waterfall that cleansed from within.

The participant saw a massive wheel-like structure containing many realities and felt the process of separation was natural and mechanical. As they came down gently from this experience, they realized they were cold and shivered, spilling their drink in the process. They quickly returned to a warm room.

Throughout the experience, there was no body load or hangover reported. The participant noted that respect for others and life was emphasized in the perceived ""space"" of the substance."
1130,45022,"The individual began their experience in a quiet cul-de-sac at midnight, surrounded by trees and a streetlamp. After inhaling the substance, they immediately felt an intense body sensation, followed by a dissolution of reality as they knew it. The participant reported seeing shapes that were previously concealed and experienced difficulty forming coherent thoughts.

In this altered state, the individual found themselves in a white-clad crowd, waiting for something unknown. A woman handed them a coffee mug, which they received with confusion. Two people from an earlier experience approached, urging the participant to stay rather than return to reality. The girl pleaded with the participant not to enter a door leading back to reality and joked about their attempt to remember the experience.

The boy laughed at her joke, and the participant eventually entered the door, regaining some awareness of reality but still experiencing intense physical sensations and confusion. Upon returning to their friend, they learned that during the trip, they had spoken about people on a plantation and started laughing, though they had no recollection of this.

After the experience, the individual drove home with their friend, who mentioned watching a movie together before the participant went to sleep."
1131,53798,"The narrator and two friends tried an unknown substance in an empty field. One friend had a vivid experience where he felt like he was in a factory with endless lines of workers, similar to scenes from ""The Wall"" DVD and ""Willy Wonka."" The narrator then took a dose and experienced a sense of being part of his friend's t-shirt, trying to arrange everyone into a pattern. He tried to leave but did not realize he was tripping until later.

A week later, the narrator had another experience with the substance. This time, before taking it, he felt an internal pressure indicating he was about to trip. He stood up and announced that he was tripping. During this experience, he engaged in a discussion which made him angry internally but not outwardly abusive. He then noticed two trees next to him had faces and were looking at him, though the faces disappeared when he looked directly at them.

After both experiences, the narrator felt very happy, possibly due to the substance's apparent anti-depressant qualities. The visual effects were not strong, but his sense of reality was significantly altered."
1132,53934,"The participant began their experience by smoking dried plant material through a water bong. They felt the effects after two inhalations, experiencing vertigo and physical impairment that led them to lie down with closed eyes. A presence of people was perceived as arriving in a circular march around the participant. The participant asked these entities to take them to a beautiful place but was told 'no'. When they tried to include a friend, they were again denied.

The experience intensified, leading to vivid visual and auditory hallucinations that blended with reality while maintaining distinct borders between dreamlike scenes and actual surroundings. A strong sense of déjà vu and understanding emerged, breaking down mental dualisms and creating new meanings from words. The participant felt a deep love for their family members who they perceived as nearby.

The presence around the participant gradually slowed its motion before transforming into an endless road that eventually faded out completely. After remaining still with closed eyes for some time, the participant returned to normal activity without experiencing any hangover effects."
1133,67729,"The participant and their friend IJ took a large dose of an unnamed psychoactive substance at IJ's house. After inhaling, the participant experienced intense laughter and was unable to move. They felt as if they were being pulled towards a corner of the room, with exaggerated hand movements. The participant saw trippy cartoon-like faces and heard a stand-up comedy act on TV, which seemed to narrate their thoughts and actions in real-time. The audience's reactions to these actions were vividly perceived by the participant.

The parents of IJ knocked on the door during the trip, but IJ assured them that the participant was just laughing. Later, CJ took a dose and experienced intense worry and wonder, repeatedly exclaiming ""What the fuck!"" when his parents entered the room."
1134,53068,"The participant began smoking an unknown substance using a water bong in their girlfriend's garage at around 4 PM. After inhaling two hits, they felt overwhelmed but happy. They saw cartoonish figures forming all around them, covering walls and objects like a mower, which seemed both real and vivid. These figures appeared to be smiling and singing, though the exact words were not remembered.

The participant felt as if they were part of these figures' world and experienced an intense feeling of euphoria. The garage itself had an unusual appearance, seeming both well-lit and outdoors at the same time. When walking towards the house, they felt a strong push-like sensation and pressure covering their body as they entered through what seemed like a portal.

Inside the kitchen, the participant laughed at the thought of the girlfriend's dog taking on the smiling form of the figures outside. The experience lasted about one to two minutes according to the participant and their girlfriend."
1135,44931,"The participant consumed an unknown substance and immediately felt disoriented, as if inside a rotating cube where they were being thrown around like a rag doll. They lost their sense of direction and balance, falling multiple times without feeling pain. During this period, they engaged in unusual behaviors such as running towards the sun and rolling down a hill.

The participant then lay on a slope away from others, experiencing a profound sense of connection with nature and an overwhelming joy that washed over them, cleansing them of sadness. They felt compelled to express their emotions through crying or shouting. After some time, they returned to camp where another friend had brought marijuana. The participant consumed more of the unknown substance later in the evening but did not remember much after this point.

One of the friends was lying on the floor, shouting about seeing a deity and dancing around while singing. The next morning, the participant felt slightly disoriented but continued to feel good overall."
1136,52763,"The participant experienced an intense trip characterized by physical sensations such as feeling like they were being pulled through a cheese grater and their body splitting in half. They also had visual hallucinations of becoming part of a Rubik's cube representing reality. The individual felt flattened and dragged just under the perceived reality, occasionally catching glimpses of friends watching over them. There was an intense longing to return to normal reality. After falling backward in a chair, they eventually came to on the ground and were shaken by the experience."
1137,52718,"The participant had two experiences with an unnamed substance. During the first session, they felt very stoned immediately after inhaling. Visual hallucinations were intense, causing everything to appear delayed and their friends to look like different versions of themselves. The user could not move or talk during this time but experienced a strong sense of reality that felt more real than normal life. Afterward, they felt sweaty and had difficulty walking.

In the second session one week later, similar visual effects occurred where the participants appeared two-dimensional and unfamiliar. These hallucinations were intense but lasted for a shorter duration compared to the first experience."
1138,44585,"The participant reports using dried leaves of a certain plant, describing an initial sensation of energetic prickling throughout their body. They feel a sense of being present in the universe, experiencing what they describe as ""Salvia Space."" During this state, they encounter an entity referred to as the ""Green Goddess,"" described as appearing like a green cloud and having Egyptian features with mother-of-pearl inlay. The participant interacts briefly with their sitter, who asks how they are feeling, but the response is distant and somewhat perplexed. Later, they engage in conversation with a friend that is harmonious and light-hearted. Upon returning to a more lucid state, they describe the experience as pleasant and reflective of being one with ""all that is."""
1139,44518,"The participant had two experiences with a substance. In the first session, they felt nothing after the initial inhalation but experienced vivid hallucinations after holding in a second hit for 25 seconds. They perceived themselves as a little boy being dragged through a store by their mother while people tried to purchase them. This led to intense paranoia and an attempt to run through a glass door, which was prevented by a friend. After about three minutes, the participant returned to reality and experienced nausea.

In the second session, they felt effects after the first inhalation but fully hallucinated on the second hit. They reported floating towards clouds and mumbling before laughing and returning to normal consciousness quickly. The experiences were short-lived and left an uncomfortable feeling in their mouth with increased salivation."
1140,44027,"The participant consumed salvia and experienced an immediate onset of effects. They felt as though they were being pulled in all directions and reality fell away, replaced by blackness and patterns. The participant's awareness shifted, becoming one with various objects such as the ground, a pillow, and their right hand. During this state, they perceived themselves to be at the level of ""workers"" within their body, feeling a strong sense of family connection towards these entities. After a sharp jolt, the participant returned to normal consciousness but noticed that the bong was missing from their hand and found it behind the speakers."
1141,43722,"The narrator shared an experience with several friends in a car. Jacob smoked multiple times, laughing and making profound statements. Alex initially felt minor effects but later giggled profusely. The narrator experienced visual distortions, feeling as if their vision was being watched by entities and seeing thousands of camera screens rotating around in a factory-like setting. They also had the sensation that someone was narrating their life. When the narrator looked at Alex's sister, she appeared to resemble an ex-girlfriend, causing them to feel like they were in love with her. The narrator hugged Alex's sister goodbye, feeling empty inside afterward. Two more girls smoked and laughed loudly. Overall, the experience included visual distortions, feelings of connection to others, and a sense of being watched by entities."
1142,53029,"The participant and two friends went into the woods near a swamp after consuming cannabis. The participant then consumed an unknown substance referred to as ""sally d 10x."" Upon inhaling, they experienced a sudden shift in perception, feeling their soul leave their body. They began laughing uncontrollably and had difficulty maintaining balance, nearly falling into the swamp.

During this state, the participant perceived reality as segmented by dividing lines that could be peeled off like velcro, producing auditory hallucinations when moving their head. The experience lasted about five minutes, during which they did not fully remember what happened. They were helped to sit in a chair and regain some composure before returning home.

The visual distortions included the fabric of reality appearing segmented with scratchy auditory effects when these segments moved or separated. After the trip, it took an hour for the participant to feel normal again, though this may have been influenced by previous cannabis consumption."
1143,53467,"The individual began by feeling an intense discomfort and itchiness before noticing patterns and grids appearing on surfaces around them. They perceived that inanimate objects were communicating with them about their recent actions and experiences, leading to uncontrollable laughter. After a period of intense interaction, the room's lighting changed, and everything seemed alive but dormant. The participant then experienced telepathic communication from various sources including music and television, which called out their name and engaged in dialogue. This continued until they turned off some devices, after which the interactions gradually subsided as they came down from the experience."
1144,43362,"The participant reported intense physical sensations approximately ten seconds after inhaling, including tingling, pressure, and tightness throughout their body. These sensations were described as painful but later transformed into an ecstatic feeling through mental focus. They felt as if they were floating away from their body while maintaining a connection to it.

Visual hallucinations included a 4-D tunnel made of text and cloth and a face on a yellow prayer flag. The participant experienced vivid imagery, such as an electric figure in darkness with tingling sensations outlined by electric lines. Sensory input was dominated by touch, with smell, taste, and sound becoming less noticeable.

The experience led to reflections on the interconnectedness of mind and body, and the participant felt waves of ecstatic feelings throughout their body, particularly at certain chakra points. They described a sense of being part of a larger collective consciousness, experiencing the energy of life flowing through them."
1145,43034,"The individual began their experience by smoking an unknown substance from a glass pipe. After inhaling, they immediately noticed intense burning sensations and increased heart rate accompanied by sweating. They attempted to walk upstairs but returned shortly after. The participant then took another hit of the substance, which intensified their experience. 

During this second round, the room appeared as if it was printed on two sides of a zipper that zipped shut, forming an image of the room in front of them. This was followed by a vision where the room transformed into a large space with marble columns and a swimming pool surrounded by curtains. The participant's friend J emerged from the pool holding a camera, which the individual found captivating.

The experience included moments where the room seemed to be projected onto layers of hanging blankets, revealing hidden parts of the room as each layer was pulled back. These visions alternated between darkness and the return of the original room setting. Throughout this period, the participant felt detached from their surroundings and had difficulty focusing on reality or engaging with others in the room.

The individual also mentioned having trouble chewing bread during the experience. The entire episode lasted several minutes but felt extremely intense to them."
1146,42953,"The participant smoked a substance in a bong and immediately entered an altered state of consciousness. They forgot where they were and believed they were part of a larger entity's handbag, with everything appearing plastic-like. The ground began shaking, and the user perceived an unzipping zipper running through Earth, causing panic and confusion. This led to visual distortions where people and objects became 2D and pancaked together. The user was lifted into the air as the zipper approached, narrowly avoiding being cut in half along with a friend who was split but not bleeding due to the plastic-like texture of everything. After about ten minutes, the effects wore off, leaving the participant disoriented and needing a breather outside. They experienced racing thoughts for some time before returning to normal."
1147,42848,"The participant began their experience by smoking a significant amount of an extract in one inhalation. Immediately after exhaling, they felt extremely hot and light-headed. They experienced visual distortions where everything except the TV appeared as parallel lines with red dots connecting them, creating a force field-like barrier around the television that prevented movement beyond it.

The participant became anxious and attempted to break through this perceived barrier by moving to another location but found similar barriers in each new environment they tried. This led to feelings of not belonging anywhere during the experience. They removed clothing despite cold weather due to overheating, felt extremely thirsty, and experienced a strong desire for water.

After some time outside, the participant returned to their friend's house where they saw beer being brought inside. The sight of the beer alleviated some anxiety, allowing them to return to a more relaxed state after drinking and smoking marijuana."
1148,42039,"The individual was at a friend's house when they decided to smoke an unknown substance. After one hit, the participant felt immediate effects. They experienced a disorienting sensation where their mind seemed to leave their body. In this altered state, they perceived themselves in a dark environment with cubes of light surrounded by brick walls. There were millions of these cubes, and the individual felt simultaneously inside each cube while also being aware of all of them at once. This created an overwhelming feeling of safety and coming home.

After what seemed like an eternity, the participant gradually returned to their body. Upon opening their eyes, they found visual information overwhelming and had difficulty processing thoughts, which echoed endlessly in their mind. They grabbed their friend's hand frantically but calmed down when seeing his scared reaction. For about 10-15 minutes after the initial effects, the individual wandered around the backyard, experiencing each moment as if it were being created anew. Speaking was difficult; they managed only to say 'Not now' in response to questions from their friend.

The high lasted approximately 20 minutes before subsiding. The participant felt a sense of exhilaration and gratitude that persisted for weeks after the experience."
1149,41806,"The participant began their experience by smoking kif and inhaling nitrous oxide, followed by salvia. The effects were intense but fragile, with reality feeling 'fake' yet clear and sharp. After the initial substances wore off, they returned home and consumed more kif and vodka before using a small amount of salvia. Upon inhalation, they immediately felt a sense of detachment from their body, which they described as the ""salvia wind."" This state allowed them to feel individual controls over different parts of their body while maintaining awareness of reality. They visualized themselves in a room with various controls and managed to step out of their physical form. During this period, they experienced an enlightening realization about infinity and reality itself. The profound experience lasted for approximately 30 minutes before fading into a high/mild intoxication state."
1150,41302,"Three friends in their late teens decided to try Salvia Divinorum together at the narrator's home. The first friend, 'T', experienced intense effects immediately after smoking a small amount, feeling like he was melting into the floor for about 30 seconds and babbling unintelligibly. The second friend did not feel any significant impact.

The narrator initially smoked a small amount but felt only a mild body high without any vivid hallucinations or visions. He then smoked a larger dose, which immediately knocked him off his feet. For ten minutes, he experienced physical uncontrol, dancing and slapping his friend on the head in a playful manner. After this period, he became introverted and irritable, feeling bothered by normal background noise.

The narrator fell asleep without experiencing any significant trippy visuals other than some distortion effects similar to those from marijuana. The overall experience did not meet his expectations of intense hallucinations or emotional effects as reported in previous accounts."
1151,40985,"The participant sat in a park with a friend after consuming two pipefuls of an extract. They immediately felt a sinking sensation, followed by altered vision where everything in their field of view separated into segmented strips that slid sideways and connected to a black-haired head. The head shouted ""I am the man who controls everything"" repeatedly.

The participant's body seemed split into segments moving in different directions, causing them to twitch. They laughed along with their friend when the word 'Laugh' appeared from the face of the man. After coming down slightly, they took another hit and saw a shadowy monk unzip and spin around, taking them with him. The monk explained that everyone is part of the Man who controls everything.

In another vision, the participant was laid on a bed while the world wound around them. They felt enlightened but confused about whether their reality had changed permanently. After 20 minutes, they returned to normal, though worried about potential links between such experiences and mental stability due to family history.

The friend tried the substance later with no effect."
1152,40610,"The participant describes two experiences with an unspecified plant extract. The first experience occurred alone at home during the day. After inhaling the substance, they felt a strong force pushing them forward and experienced visual hallucinations, such as drapery moving in a breeze despite closed windows. They also laughed uncontrollably while listening to music. The entire experience lasted about 20-30 minutes.

In the second experience, conducted with a friend named T after school, both participants felt the effects of the substance simultaneously. T appeared disoriented and was looking out into the rain. The narrator experienced intense laughter again and eventually urinated in their pants due to the intensity of the joy. They then drove around listening to music until the effects wore off."
1153,40429,"The participant smoked an unknown substance twice in their darkened bedroom. During the first dose, they experienced altered perceptions where their room appeared distorted, with walls seemingly pushed back. Two entities were present but not well remembered. The effects lasted under 30 seconds before returning to reality. 

For the second dose, taken less than five minutes later, the experience was more intense and distressing. In a darkened room, they saw several entities (likely smelves) rearranging furniture. They felt fear when realizing their room appeared to be in a large convention hall with other similar rooms. The entities continued their activity despite the participant's attempts to stop them. 

The participant became overwhelmed by anxiety and fear, believing they might never return to normal reality. As the effects began to subside, turning on a bedside lamp helped reassure them that they were back in their own room. Upon returning to reality, they felt itchy, nervous, hungry, scared, anxious, and tired simultaneously."
1154,70827,"The participant experienced an intense trip where they felt disconnected from reality for about 10 minutes. They reported sensations of their limbs being ripped off and ceasing to exist along with time. During the experience, they saw god as everyone in the room being torn apart, describing it as chaos. The participant felt pulled and cracked, with a sense that god was breaking down. There was an overwhelming feeling of dark energy making existence difficult. Suddenly, puzzle pieces reformed, suggesting the participant was sent back to their normal state."
1155,50106,"The participant describes several experiences with a substance, initially feeling no effect but then experiencing a shift in gravity and difficulty forming words during the first session. In subsequent sessions, holding the smoke in for longer produced more pronounced effects: euphoria, visual distortions where objects appeared taller and colors were vivid, and a sense of smallness compared to surroundings. The participant also noted difficulty seeing their friend Tim, who was sitting near them at a computer. After each experience, there was a positive after-effect including a marijuana buzz and an overall happy mood."
1156,69523,"The participant inhaled a small amount of an extract and experienced immediate effects. Initially, they felt as though time had stopped around them while their thoughts continued uninterrupted. This was followed by intense physical sensations including pressure that felt like being crushed or experiencing super gravity, coldness, and sweating profusely. The individual reported feeling resigned to the experience, likening it to a near-death state but not fully there yet. They tried to look back at where they had been during this altered state but found themselves alone without any guidance. Upon returning to reality, they noticed their hands were soaking wet."
1157,49915,"The participant smoked a small amount of an unknown substance they believed to be Salvia divinorum. Immediately after consumption, they felt physically rigid, making it difficult to move their arms or legs with normal effort. They perceived the room as filled with translucent cubes, resembling a three-dimensional tetris game.

After this initial visual effect, the participant experienced a brief period where their perception of dimensions fractured. They could see objects from impossible angles and had difficulty moving through what they perceived as extra-dimensional space. This was accompanied by an image of multiple copies of themselves sitting in chairs, extending into the distance, similar to video feedback. The experience lasted no more than three or four seconds before returning to normal.

The participant then smoked another portion of the substance but did not achieve the same effects."
1158,39993,"The narrator and his friend Alex consumed an unnamed substance in the backyard of the narrator's house. After a few minutes, Alex began to experience visual hallucinations and told the narrator he was tripping. The narrator then took his turn and felt the effects more intensely than expected. He saw purple and black zippers moving rapidly across the lawn and noticed that the fence, which usually had only a few vines, appeared covered in hundreds of animated green vines.

Feeling frightened but laughing hysterically, they moved inside to the bedroom. In the room, the narrator observed that the carpet split into two layers, one being the actual carpet and the other lines hovering above it. The music wouldn't play when he tried to turn it on. He became extremely annoyed with Alex and had a hard time communicating coherently during a phone call with their friend James.

The narrator's fear increased as he paced back and forth in an attempt to calm himself down. He went downstairs for water, turned on the TV, and saw what appeared to be a horror scene from America's Funniest Home Videos before quickly switching it off. As the trip began to wear off, he expressed his discomfort with the experience but acknowledged its enlightening nature."
1159,12298,"The narrator and two others consumed an extract from an unnamed plant in the evening. They prepared a pipe using an apple and smoked a low dose of the substance. The narrator experienced mild confusion, with their body acting independently of their mind. After 10 minutes, they returned to baseline.

Next, the brother tried the substance but had difficulty smoking it due to its potency. He felt some effects but was anxious to try again using a gravity bong. The roommate also smoked the substance and became disoriented after 10 minutes before joining the others on the couch.

Later, the narrator and his brother built a gravity bong and used it with a larger dose of the extract. After inhaling half of the smoke, the narrator experienced intense visual impairment, seeing earthy tones and feeling disconnected from reality. He felt as though everything was part of him or he was part of everything else.

A being appeared to the narrator, described as having strange green patterns and an open mouth with teeth that laughed at him. The being communicated verbally, questioning whether the narrator respected the plant and its effects. The narrator argued with the being, expressing a desire to learn from it by asking questions about life after death and existence beyond. However, the being did not answer these questions directly and instead mocked the narrator's inquiries.

The narrator gradually returned to baseline over the next half hour but felt that the experience had left him questioning his approach to the substance."
1160,38605,"The participant consumed several doses of an unknown substance and experienced immediate physical effects including lightheadedness and difficulty standing upright. After consuming three bowls, they felt their body buzzing and vibrating, with limbs drifting away from them. Visual distortions included books on the bookshelf appearing to breathe and vibrate, walls melting like wax or paint, and wood paneling rippling like water before dissecting into multiple pieces separated by black space.

The participant also reported a shadowy presence that they described as resembling shadows of poems. This experience lasted approximately 20 minutes, followed by a period of about 45 minutes where the individual felt between reality and the altered state but was aware of their surroundings. During this time, they wrote a poem describing their sensations."
1161,38536,"The participant began their experience by inhaling smoke from an unnamed substance, which immediately transported them out of the room they were in. They felt as though their soul had detached from their body and was flowing towards a doorway. This doorway had walls made of what appeared to be clouds or smoke. At this doorway, there were presences that called out to the participant, inviting them inside.

Behind the doorway, the participant saw blackness and a sky also appearing black. They felt as though they were not seeing these things through their physical eyes because they no longer had a body in this state. The experience was described as more real than anything else they had ever experienced.

The participant then began to be pulled away from this place back towards the room where they started. During this process, they briefly saw another person who was also experiencing the substance and felt part of their thoughts for an instant. This back-and-forth movement between the two states continued for a few minutes until the participant slowly accepted that they were back in the familiar world.

After returning to the physical world, the participant experienced confusion and disbelief. They touched others to confirm reality and felt themselves being dragged back into the other state several times before fully accepting their return. The experience left them feeling spiritually enlightened but also emotionally deflated and slightly sad as they tried to come to terms with what had happened."
1162,37175,"The participant sat in a room with a friend, using electronic music as background, to enhance their experience. After several unsuccessful attempts at smoking salvia, they decided to load both a pipe and a bong for immediate consecutive use. Upon inhaling from the first bowl, they noticed mild effects including dizziness and reduced coordination. The second bowl brought about more pronounced changes.

The room appeared to melt, with peripheral vision narrowing and objects morphing into new forms. The participant experienced vivid imagery reminiscent of childhood memories, reliving emotions rather than just recalling events. A spot on the ceiling transformed into a crab that repeatedly crawled through an imaginary hole before reappearing in its original position. During this time, the music faded away, replaced by silence.

The experience lasted several minutes, with the room eventually returning to view and the participant feeling similar to their state prior to the second bowl."
1163,37013,"The participant consumed an unknown substance in their dorm room with a friend after drinking vodka. They smoked what appeared to be one hit of high potency Salvia. Immediately after inhaling, they felt a slight difference in perception similar to the onset of LSD. Visual and auditory hallucinations followed: machines approached from all directions, flattening the participant's world into an inch-thick state with difficulty breathing. The participant heard only machine noises for about a minute before their friend coached them through what felt like swimming. As this occurred, the participant experienced layers peeling off their body as they returned to normal consciousness. They fell to their knees and almost face-planted but was caught by their friend. Physical sensations of ripping continued to subside after regaining full awareness."
1164,36998,"The individual initially tried a small amount of the substance but experienced only mild sensations such as static dancing over their body without significant visuals or an immersive experience. After several days and another attempt, they ingested a larger dose in a dark room late at night. This time, the effects were more pronounced.

Upon taking the first hit, the participant felt an immediate onset of intense effects. They experienced their skin being pulled off their body from feet to head, which caused panic as it approached their head. The surroundings had a plastic-like feel, and the sensation was akin to shelving pieces of skin. As the effect progressed, they encountered entities within their mind that appeared to be other souls living their life with them. These entities did not communicate verbally but were perceived as announcing their presence.

The experience ended quickly, and the participant felt at peace despite the initial terror."
1165,36820,"The participant joined friends to consume an unknown substance in two separate sessions. In the first session, they smoked the substance inside a room with dim lighting. Upon inhalation, the user experienced uncontrollable laughter, profuse sweating, and physical discomfort described as a ""slant."" Visual hallucinations included cosmic rays of multicolored lights and noise, along with difficulty controlling body movements.

In the second session, the group consumed the substance while driving on an oceanside boulevard. The visual effects were less harsh compared to the indoor experience. Trees appeared like those from a Super Mario game, houses wiggled, cars looked like giant sea creatures, sailboats turned into battleships shooting rainbows, and street signs became unreadable jibberish. The user experienced uncontrollable laughter throughout both sessions.

The overall duration of each session was approximately half an hour indoors and fifteen minutes outdoors."
1166,36806,"The participant began their experience alone in a dimly lit room at night, using an unnamed substance. Initially, they felt boxed in by gravity but then entered another realm where they perceived how reality functions. They observed various scenes and met two non-human entities that acted as tour guides throughout the trip. The participant experienced an out-of-body sensation, floating over their own body while it was tripping.

They also reported merging with a pillow, feeling connected to its fibers on a cellular level, before transforming into a tree root, experiencing warmth and connection to everything around them. These experiences were vivid and emotional. The trip lasted nearly 15 minutes, peaking early and fading quickly, leaving the participant sober about 20 minutes after the experience ended with an afterglow."
1167,35646,"The participant began by smoking a large bowl of leaf, holding each hit for about 23 seconds before moving on to the next bowl. During this process, they heard encouraging voices that sounded familiar. After exhaling towards their phone, which was talking to them, they apologized to their sink counter and then smoked a bowl of 5x. The furniture began singing, advising the participant to improve their trip area; for example, the carpet suggested pulling it up the wall.

Next, the participant inhaled a large hit of 10x, holding it for about 25 seconds. This led to a more intense experience where they were on some unusual furniture and heard songs from inanimate objects that repeated instructions, making them feel as though they were in trouble or recalling childhood troubles. The visuals included familiar objects around them.

After coming down from the trip, which was uncomfortable and cold, the participant tried another hit of 5x while lying on their bed. This time, they felt pushed against the wall by an unseen force and interacted with a talking extension cord. Wooden items in the room were smiling at them and reminded the participant to turn off the light, which they had forgotten to do.

In subsequent attempts with 5x, the furniture joined in singing, which was somewhat annoying for the participant who does not usually sing."
1168,34337,"The participant consumed an unknown substance for the first time using a bong with chilled water and ice cubes. After inhaling the smoke quickly, they experienced a sudden onset of effects. A strong tug was felt on the right side of their body, which moved their head slowly towards its source without conscious control. The participant also noted profuse sweating throughout their body. They communicated briefly with their sitter during the experience, which lasted approximately 5 minutes."
1169,33948,"The participant began their experience in a dimly lit room with calming music playing. After taking several hits from an extract, they felt heavy and experienced visual patterns of bisecting lines that appeared to split their body symmetrically. They then packed another bowl and continued to inhale the substance. As the effects intensified, they saw small humanoid figures resembling ""pez smurfs"" which later transformed into crowds of people reaching upwards.

The participant felt compelled to take a ride but hesitated before finally giving in. During this journey, they spiraled through themselves, experiencing laughter and familiar sensations. The experience then shifted to a dartboard-like image composed of people of various colors radiating outward. Inside their mind, the walls were made up of recurring human figures that moved based on the participant's gaze.

The participant felt energy moving through unused parts of their brain before coming down from the trip. They described feeling curious and somewhat disoriented afterward. The experience involved vivid visual hallucinations and introspective journeys with recurring themes of crowds and self-exploration."
1170,33501,"The participant began with small doses of an unspecified substance, feeling pressure and visual distortions such as seeing a double helix rotating before them. They experienced disorientation and left their room but did not find relief from the sensations. Later, they attempted another dose in a more relaxed setting, using incense and asking for protection. This time, they entered a dreamlike trance with shivers of emotion running down their spine and energy spewing from the top of their head. They reported feeling perfect harmony with the world and eventually found what seemed to be a tunnel vision effect. The experience concluded around 4:30 am, after which the participant felt extremely refreshed."
1171,33070,"The participant smoked four dried leaves of the substance while standing beside their backyard sweatlodge on a summer evening. They reported visual distortions such as trees twisting and descending towards them. This was followed by an immersive perception where they felt submerged in their patio environment, with only their eyes and upper head above ground, looking over a pink surface which turned out to be the patio paver blocks. The participant also experienced a temporary separation of mind and body, leading to physical disorientation and falling down."
1172,32701,"The experience began around 20:10 when two individuals consumed an unspecified substance and shared a bowl of another substance known for its immediate effects. They went out to eat dinner at about 21:30. By 21:50, both noticed that the lights in the restaurant appeared brighter with shimmering colored halos around them. People outside their table seemed to move quickly, as if time was passing more slowly for them.

After dinner, they visited a friend's place and consumed another unspecified substance at about 23:15. The effects were noticeable but not overpoweringly psychedelic. Around 01:00 in the morning, they tried an additional substance, which one of their friends described as causing a sensation of falling backwards or being ""sucked into the floor."" One friend laughed uncontrollably for approximately five minutes.

The experience with the first substance was noted to be particularly enjoyable and laid-back. The next day, there were no lingering negative effects from any of the substances consumed."
1173,32658,"The participant began with a slight body buzz after consuming the substance through smoking and chewing. After taking an extremely deep hit, they experienced more pronounced effects. The walls appeared to flex outward as if making way for them, and there was a sensation of their left leg bending in a rubbery manner while walking. Upon lying down, they felt an almost outside-of-self view of their surroundings and life in general. They saw visual hallucinations of WWII British Bombers in negative form while listening to music about the bombing of Dresden. The participant also experienced a feeling of sinking into the mattress, similar to the main character ODing on dope in Trainspotting. The body buzz lasted for another hour after the peak effects had subsided."
1174,31742,"The participant and their companion, referred to as G, consumed an extract of a substance while sitting on a rock by a lake during sunset. After the first hit, the participant experienced a sense of time bending, visualizing it as a half-circle being morphed or melted. They felt calm and comfortable but struggled to express these feelings verbally. The participant then took another hit, experiencing lightness and clarity. During this period, they noticed intricate patterns in moss on nearby rocks, finding beauty in what was initially perceived as mundane. The experience was gradual in onset and comedown, with the participant expressing interest in exploring deeper levels of the substance's effects."
1175,31344,"The participant and two friends tried a substance for the first time together. Initially, the effects were mild, with patterns on the ground appearing to move slowly towards the observer in certain directions but not others. As they continued, the participant noticed an area between his girlfriend and friend Jess that appeared as a butterfly pattern moving in a flipbook animation style. This led him to shout ""I am SO on drugs"" and laugh.

The participant then perceived falling into an orange checkerboard universe which felt threatening. He experienced a sensation of his head's trajectory being pre-mapped in the air, described as very strange. The shared perception with Jess was exciting but taxing. When standing up, he had the urge to tear away reality, feeling cartoonish near a nearby fence.

After returning from the fence, the participant noticed his girlfriend seemed unusually angry and felt her negative emotions resonating strongly within him. He expressed this to her, but she dismissed it and went inside, which left him with guilt. The intense effects faded quickly, leaving only slight dizziness and lingering awe for about 10 minutes."
1176,31340,"The participant smoked an unknown substance with three friends using a hookah. They held each hit for about 20 seconds before exhaling slightly and inhaling oxygen, repeating this process multiple times over several minutes. During one particularly long session lasting around eight minutes, they experienced vivid closed-eye visuals of a small red muscular creature resembling a squirrel or chipmunk inside them. This entity controlled their movements, causing the participant's face and body to tighten significantly.

The situation outside became progressively more strange as people noticed the participant's unusual behavior. The experience was described as getting weirder with each passing moment, culminating in everyone around forming a semi-circle staring at the participant without understanding what was happening. The individual felt an increasing amount of energy radiating from their body and experienced difficulty stopping their actions despite trying to do so.

After the session ended, the participant tried to explain their experience but found that others were too high or confused to understand. They spent the rest of the night relaxing on a couch, reflecting on what had occurred."
1177,49260,"The experience began with the participant inhaling a substance and immediately seeing their parent's home in 1975 while still being aware of their current living room. The participant experienced a duality of consciousness, where they could see both realities at once: on one side was the present day (2005) with their friend watching them, and on the other side was the past (1975). In between these two realities were Rubik's Cubes that seemed to blend the two worlds together.

As the participant focused more on the 1975 reality, they felt as if they were becoming a seven-year-old child. They described everything in this reality as brighter and sharper, with an absence of pre-judgment. The participant tried to maintain their connection to both realities but eventually had to choose between them.

The experience lasted about 15 minutes, during which the participant attempted to explain what was happening to their friend."
1178,35052,"The experience began shortly after inhaling smoke from two large leaves of an unspecified plant. The effects were immediate but subtle at first. The participant felt their surroundings melting backwards as they turned to look. They then found themselves in a crowded place, rushing somewhere important with a droning noise surrounding them. Three pillar-like entities appeared, which the participant perceived as living beings guiding the crowd. These pillars communicated non-verbally and seemed annoyed when the participant dropped the smoking device. The participant promised to return to learn from these entities.

The experience lasted about three minutes but felt longer due to altered perception of time. Aftereffects included heightened senses for about 30 minutes, followed by a restful sleep with vivid dreams. The next day, the participant reported feeling at peace and in tune with the world."
1179,35201,"The narrator and three friends consumed a substance in a room where two of them were playing video games. The narrator inhaled the substance slowly and steadily until reaching their coughing threshold. They experienced physical sensations including waves of water slapping against their back and limbs, which made it difficult to maintain balance. As a result, they kept sinking into D's bed and struggled to sit upright. Sweating profusely with cold sweat was another sensation reported.

During the trip, one friend (D) screamed something that startled the narrator, who responded by passing the substance bag to D, thinking that is what D wanted. The narrator could not speak during this time but made high-pitched grunting noises similar to laughter in an intense experience. After about 4-5 minutes, the physical sensations subsided, and the narrator was able to communicate again.

Upon regaining speech, the narrator asked why D had yelled ""Take the ticket,"" only to learn that D had not spoken at all during the trip."
1180,29963,"The participant had three experiences with an unnamed substance. In the first setting at a park at night, they smoked a whole bowl of the substance and felt an immediate rush, questioning reality and asking friends if they were real due to intense intoxication. The second experience took place in their room alone or with one friend, where visual hallucinations occurred, including a circular visual field and a narrator giving cliched advice. Text on a poster changed according to the narrator's speech. In the third experience, also in their room but with music playing, colorful patterns were seen and mild synesthesia was experienced."
1181,27452,"The individual began their experience after consuming a substance and smoking it through a glass pipe. As they smoked, they felt a metallic prickling sensation throughout their body, particularly in their mouth. Their vision started to fade from the periphery towards the center until everything disappeared.

In this altered state, the participant found themselves in an unfamiliar environment that they referred to as ""plastic land,"" characterized by an artificial sheen. They were then guided to a screen-like device where they witnessed a detailed account of their life from birth onwards. The experience was not first-person but rather observed from above or from unusual vantage points, suggesting it was recorded from various perspectives.

The visual depiction included significant events such as childhood injuries and the death of a family member. It also showed future projections including career paths, relationships, and personal achievements. Notably, the participant saw themselves having three children and owning a restaurant in the future. There were also glimpses of a significant death when they would be in their forties and eventually dying an old man.

The experience concluded with a time-lapse depiction of decomposition and rebirth as blue flowers. After this extensive journey through life, the individual returned to reality sitting about thirty yards from where they had smoked, alongside their friend J who was also present but did not partake in the substance.

Upon returning to normal consciousness, the participant felt shaken and spent considerable time reflecting on the experience over the following days."
1182,25350,"The individual began by smoking a psychoactive substance from a water pipe while seated on a couch with two friends present. After inhaling, they immediately felt strong visual distortions and physical sensations. The room and everything in it appeared to be rolling up into a wheel-like formation, including the participants themselves. They perceived their companions as unfamiliar entities and experienced fear and disorientation.

The participant attempted to resist this sensation but was unable to do so. They rolled off the couch onto the floor and continued moving around while experiencing intense visual distortions. The music playing in the background seemed unfamiliar and contributed to a sense of being part of a game show or entertainment.

After some time, the effects began to dissipate, and the participant regained consciousness. They were informed by their friends that they had spilled the substance during their movements on the floor. The individual felt amazed at regaining awareness of reality and went about their day feeling flabbergasted by the experience."
1183,55261,"The participant smoked a significant amount of an unnamed substance in a small, dark treehouse with a friend as their sitter. Initially, they saw a figure resembling a woman's head in their peripheral vision and felt as though there were two planes of reality. They experienced a loss of control over their thoughts and body, with their voice sounding deep and strange according to the sitter. The walls of the treehouse disappeared, and pastel-colored boxes began spinning around them, creating an overwhelming sense of being lost in a dream-like state.

After several minutes, these visual distortions formed into a seat beneath the participant, allowing them to rest. Upon returning to normal consciousness, they felt terrified that they had gone insane but eventually calmed down after about five minutes. The sitter reported that the participant had been laughing and flapping their arms for approximately five minutes during the experience.

The effects gradually subsided over 30 minutes, leaving the participant feeling calm yet uneasy."
1184,52932,"The participant smoked the substance with friends at a golf course under moonlight. After inhaling, they experienced initial anxiety and fear but then felt clear-headed. They perceived one friend (C) as a hostile military figure and another as angry people wanting something from them. The user also had an experience where they felt like they were being cut in half by a 2D earth surface that was slicing into their arm. These experiences lasted for about three minutes before the effects wore off, and the participant returned to baseline."
1185,27659,"The individual began the experience by inhaling an extract through a pipe while lying in bed. During the trip, they felt as though their eyes were flitting around as if in REM sleep and experienced a pleasant sensation when closing their eyelids. The participant reported that random thoughts from their workday influenced the experience, leading to what seemed like practical insights. They formulated questions in their mind and perceived answers related to coworker relations and customer satisfaction. One question was about whether someone would remain upset with them, to which they felt an immediate response: ""only while you continue to be upset with her."""
1186,22606,"The individual smoked an unknown substance in their apartment after resolving to achieve a high from it. They felt as though they had withdrawn from their body, observing themselves from above and behind. Time seemed to slow down, filling their ears with a buzzing sound similar to a delay effect. The participant could see through the ground and walls into another dimension characterized by intersecting grid lines.

A snake-like form appeared on the wall, seemingly connected to the buzzing sound. Two faces then materialized: one described as perfectly evil and grinning, which communicated ""What are you doing here? Are you alone? We're going to hurt you."" The other face was cold and emotionless with some sort of armor covering it. These faces remained motionless and unresponsive after the participant's inquiries.

The experience left a lasting impression on the individual, who felt slapped in the face for not being respectful during their spiritual journey."
1187,21792,"The participant smoked a substance three times in quick succession while lying down in their room. They reported feeling as though they entered another dimension beneath the current one where everything was interconnected and flowed together harmoniously. Music became a solid force, with each sound wave felt physically moving through the space. The experience made them feel like pure spirit, disconnected from their physical body which they viewed merely as a tool for experiencing reality.

While in this state, there was an underlying sense of anxiety that something wasn't quite right and an internal unease rather than external social anxiety. This feeling enhanced their awareness but also created discomfort. They felt the urge to do something after the trip ended but couldn't pinpoint what it was. Motor skills were impaired post-trip, leading them to choke on soda.

The participant expressed a desire to experience this substance again in natural settings with others and emphasized the importance of having someone present (a sitter) due to the physical impairments that follow the trip."
1188,25478,"The participant began their experience at around 10 p.m. in a friend's kitchen, using an unnamed substance while others used cannabis. After taking two hits of the substance from a bong, the participant moved to the garage where they continued to smoke more bongs. Around 10 minutes after the first hit and about five minutes after finishing the last bong, the participant reported feeling as if they had left their body. They experienced visual distortions such as growing shadows and changes in color perception, eventually seeing only black.

The participant felt like they were floating and flying through space and time before coming to a stop above what appeared to be a purple/blue planet. A voice in their head repeatedly said ""The General,"" making the participant feel powerful and in control of the planet below. The voice then asked, ""What's your decision, General?"" After this, the participant felt as if they were pulled back into their body.

Upon returning to physical awareness, one friend expressed concern about the participant's prolonged stillness. The trip lasted approximately 30 minutes but felt much shorter to the participant. Following the experience, the individual reported increased confidence and a sense of control over their fate."
1189,42748,"The experience began in a small pine-forested area behind a fence near a local mall. After consuming the substance, the participant felt as though they were part of the fence and was riding along an English country road made of reddish clay. They heard themselves making hellish grunting and moaning sounds, interspersed with hysterical laughter.

The scene then changed to the participant perceiving themselves as a neighborhood consisting of identical houses in a suburban planned community. From atop something indescribable, they surveyed their surroundings while struggling against an unknown force. The neighborhood faded in and out into a surreal state where the houses appeared as branches from a fallen pine tree nearby.

In another phase, the participant perceived themselves lying sideways on their right side, with transparent neighborhoods visible as branches of the fallen pine branch. After some time, they slowly returned to reality, uprighting themselves and preparing to share the experience with their tripsitter.

Later in the session, while at a new location with a hanging pine bough, the participant pointed at various locations on the branch and slurred, ""You're not my family!"" They then dropped their arm and yelled, ""You're not coming on the plane with me!"" before lapsing into silence. As they came down from the experience, they remembered repeating over and over again, ""You're not real,"" though this was likely in their head as no verbal confirmation exists."
1190,42464,"The participant began the experience after consuming an unknown substance over a period of three hours. Following this, they consumed salvia by smoking it mixed with another substance. Immediately after inhalation, they experienced dizziness and sweating. The music playing at the time became intensely pleasurable and felt as if it permeated their entire body.

Visual hallucinations soon followed, with mouths appearing on walls and other surfaces in the room. These mouths mimicked the participant's facial expressions. The desktop wallpaper also came to life, showing a man painting them onto the scene. The room appeared in fisheye vision, and various posters and objects began moving or exhibiting unusual behaviors, such as laughing, swaying, smiling, and wagging tails.

The experience was described as very intense, with the participant feeling as if they were being painted onto everything they saw. They smoked another substance to help relax during this time. The overall effect of the salvia was reported as highly vivid and immersive, with a strong sensory impact that lasted for an extended period."
1191,43105,"During the described experience, the participant felt their skin pricking as if being touched by thousands of soothing needles. They also perceived a subtle, indescribable quality that made them feel like an old friend was greeting them. The experience lasted about 5 minutes with intense hallucinations followed by another 20-30 minutes of minor symptoms.

The most vivid hallucination involved the participant's senses being split into two sets separated by a plane running between their tongue and the roof of their mouth. These perceptions were represented as opposite ends of a snake-like figure that usually stayed latched together, creating normal reality. However, during this trip, the ""snake"" unlatched, causing both ends to flail into different realities. When the participant tried to speak by opening their mouth, the snake would unlatch again and thrash around until it reconnected.

The participant's friends' voices sounded like they were trying to trick them back into a loop that was perceived as a trap or prison. After coming out of the hallucinations, the participant felt dazed, uncomfortable, and tired for about an hour."
1192,19016,"The participant began their experience in a brightly decorated room filled with various lights and objects. After inhaling the smoke from a small pipe, they immediately felt intense physical sensations of vibration, twisting, and crawling throughout their body. These sensations were so overwhelming that they could not move properly. The participant then encountered visual hallucinations upon entering the room again, including thousands of tiny glowing plant people engaged in an orgy on the walls.

While trying to escape these visions, the participant was chased by long, glowing plant tendrils until reaching a mirror where they heard a voice telling them they were not yet ready but would be shown something. The trip then calmed down as the participant sat in the living room and later ate a peach, experiencing unpleasant sensations while eating.

In the kitchen, with Rachel's mother present, the participant saw themselves walking through a forest pathway. However, when questioned by Rachel's mother about their father, who is an alcoholic, the trip gradually tapered off."
1193,42597,"The participant initially tried a small amount of the substance in a park setting but did not experience significant effects. Two days later, they consumed a larger dose at home around 10 AM. They felt their spirit had disconnected from their body and experienced delayed sensations, particularly when walking barefoot. The TV was barely noticeable to them.

The participant reported feeling as though life was a joke with little meaning and described the sensation of slipping off an edge without falling. They sat still in a chair for most of the experience, contemplating the nature of existence and feeling overwhelmed by the anticipation of returning to normalcy. There were no interactions with entities or additional sensory experiences mentioned beyond these perceptions.

The overall experience was described as strange but rewarding, providing insights into life's true nature and one's place within it. The participant expressed a newfound respect for the substance's power to teach and give wisdom, likening it to tools used by shamans for spiritual exploration."
1194,50622,"Two individuals experienced a strong effect after smoking an unknown substance. Initially outside, they felt cold and laughed uncontrollably before returning to their room. Time perception was altered; one person perceived time as passing slowly while the other thought it passed quickly. They listened to ambient music and tried to stay calm.

On a second attempt, with proper preparation, the participant experienced vivid hallucinations and an animistic environment where everything appeared alive. The rug, TV, glass of water, and the substance itself seemed to have spirits or consciousness. The participant felt as if they were on a beach in Arizona, regressed to childhood with their girlfriend acting as a caregiver.

The television briefly interrupted the experience, seemingly affirming its own existence. Outside, palm trees swayed, and a small blue ball under a patio chair was noticed and found amusing. As the effects wore off, the participant returned upstairs with their girlfriend, who had started experiencing the effects of another substance she had taken earlier."
1195,29623,"On a September afternoon, the participant attended a gathering at their friend's house where several people were smoking a substance from a bong. After watching others smoke, the participant decided to try a different substance they had brought with them. They smoked two hits and immediately felt a ""weight"" pressing in on them.

Visual disturbances began almost instantly, with large colored dots floating around and rainbows appearing through the cracks in the wooden deck. The participant reported seeing people without faces moving about as if in another dimension. Their thoughts raced, revealing complex mysteries that they could not remember later. They experienced a sense of their soul detaching from their body, entering what felt like an alternate reality where time, hearing, taste, sight, and other perceptions lost meaning.

The experience lasted approximately three minutes according to others present, though the participant was unsure how long it actually felt. The aftereffects were described as pleasant and profound."
1196,15801,"The individual began their experience by smoking small doses of an unnamed substance through a bong. Initially, they felt mildly humorous and noticed objects in the room appearing more pronounced. As the effects intensified, they experienced a tingling sensation that moved up from their spine to their head. They reported feeling both distanced and closer to everything around them.

During this experience, the participant perceived a female presence, which they described as friendly but not menacing. This presence seemed to communicate with them in a playful manner. The individual attempted another intense hit but found it too harsh to continue smoking, leading to an accidental spray of bong water across the floor. Visually, the arc of water appeared to stretch endlessly while maintaining its real-world dimensions.

The experience concluded with a milder buzz similar to marijuana. The participant emphasized treating the substance with respect and choosing smoking buddies carefully."
1197,47277,"The participant smoked a substance and immediately felt their world warp. They found a picture of Stalin on a binder extremely funny and repeatedly turned to look at it. Later, they perceived their friend as a Swedish school bus driver driving down a mountain lane, appearing somewhat cartoony. After smoking another bowl, the participant experienced intense hallucinations involving tactile and gustatory sensations. They felt God grabbing them from behind with a giant hand and slamming them against an orange planet. The sensation was of being scraped or shaved by the planet while half their body existed inside it. The participant tasted the planet, which they found unpleasant. As the effects wore off after about an hour, they felt tired and lazy but returned to normal once fully down."
1198,13342,"The participant experienced two distinct drug-induced states: one involving salvia and another with cannabis. During the salvia experience, they perceived themselves on a beach while lying in their bed, felt an unusual cold texture where blankets touched their face, and had an internal monologue in a Cajun accent guiding their thoughts. They also reported visual hallucinations of red, green, and blue figures moving slowly when closing their eyes. Additionally, there was a sensation of the body gaining another dimension, similar to hanging upside down but more intense.

Two weeks later, while smoking cannabis, they experienced vivid visuals and an uncomfortable high. After lying down, they felt the same cold texture on their face as during the salvia experience. This triggered a brief flashback where they perceived themselves transitioning from 3D to 4D space before returning to normal consciousness."
1199,28926,"The participant had two experiences with the substance: one alone at home and another with a friend named Alex. In the first instance, they felt effects similar to mushrooms but these subsided within 20 minutes. On the second occasion, after consuming the substance with their friend, the participant experienced intense visual distortions including flashing and spinning visuals. They also reported feeling extremely uncomfortable in their clothes and on the floor where they were lying.

The participant then perceived themselves as being in a vast desert, feeling detached from reality and experiencing fear mixed with uncontrollable laughter. They believed Alex was laughing at them from above, though this may have been an illusion. Gradually, the participant regained awareness of their surroundings and realized what had happened during the trip. The experience was described as extremely intense compared to previous trips on other substances."
1200,31138,"The participant smoked a substance in their bedroom with lights on and no distractions. They experienced initial numbness followed by visual distortions of their room. Their body became frozen in place, and they saw their history as pages extending from them. A tube appeared to be going through their face without causing pain. After exhaling the smoke, they felt a sense of duty to complete certain actions but couldn't move much. They stepped out of the bedroom and felt intense coldness and disappointment directed at them. Walking down the hall, they viewed themselves as an ugly old hunchbacked man, which caused shivers. The participant took a shower and returned to their room with colorful closed-eye visuals and racing thoughts. They experienced nausea from blood imagery and struggled to comprehend alien emotions. The next day, they felt good but had a slight headache."
1201,27151,"The individual began their journey at home with their wife as a sitter. They started with a small dose and experienced no effects initially. After increasing the dosage, they felt a rush that separated them from their body, allowing movement but causing blurriness in vision and making music seem tangible. The participant felt carefree and playful.

As the experience intensified with a larger dose, the individual entered a state of fear, visualizing dimly colorful tunnels that seemed to shift like an unsolvable puzzle. They were unable to find their wife initially but managed to turn on the room light, which helped ground them temporarily. However, they continued to be pulled in and out of different places by the experience.

The participant experienced intense fear and tears during this period. The journey included various stories that left a lasting impression. Despite the intensity, the individual felt it was life-changing and provided valuable insights."
1202,47639,"The participant began the session with his friend J, who experienced strong effects from two hits of Salvia extract but found the trip unpleasant. Another friend S tried it next and reported milder visuals. T then joined and had a more intense visual experience after two hits. The author decided to take a larger dose, inhaling more than before. This led to an extremely vivid and disorienting experience characterized by altered perceptions of gravity and reality. He felt as if he was part of a rubber band being pulled in different directions and experienced a ""waterfall"" effect at the doorway between rooms, requiring him to move through two levels of reality. The author also reported feeling like he had become the main character from Trainspotting. As the effects wore off, he felt tired but eventually returned to normal."
1203,33824,"The individual entered a room containing four wooden chairs around a small table, with bare white walls and minimal furnishings. After smoking an unidentified substance twice, they felt extremely high almost immediately. The participant then smoked salvia from a bubbler, first taking a small hit and later increasing the dosage to about double the initial amount.

During the experience, the room's scene froze in place, and the individual perceived themselves as a ""sack of skin filled with red stuff."" They observed textures and colors around them that seemed to waver and 'breathe' relative to their unique characteristics. The visual hallucinations were described as comparable to those experienced on mushrooms.

After increasing the dosage, the intensity of the experience increased significantly. The individual noted a sensation of being pulled down by an invisible force while waving their hands side-to-side, feeling as though they were petting an invisible object. The visual effects continued for about 10 minutes after the second hit and included 'bleeding' textures.

The participant sat still in awe for extended periods, estimating that they had been in the room for approximately one hour."
1204,36343,"The participant took two inhalations of a substance and experienced mild effects approximately 15 minutes after starting. They felt slightly numb and euphoric, with no significant loss of concentration or short-term memory. Internally, they imagined themselves in a cockpit preparing for a roller coaster ride, while externally the world appeared somewhat altered but remained recognizable. The participant noted that borders around objects seemed to melt and bend slightly when focusing on the clock's second hand. They felt a slight hypnotic state during this focus but snapped out of it upon shifting their gaze. Overall, the experience lasted about 10 minutes before wearing off, leaving them feeling similar to being moderately high on marijuana."
1205,25990,"The participant began the experience in a dark room while intoxicated from alcohol and cannabis. They then used another substance (likely Salvia divinorum) and experienced visual hallucinations where the keys of their keyboard appeared to be rivers flowing around them. The participant felt compelled to type, with the music on their computer singing what they typed simultaneously. When they hesitated or made a mistake while typing, there was a corresponding hesitation or error in the singing.

The participant then perceived larger rivers forming behind an instant message window and wrapping around them like ropes. They panicked and attempted to run away from these perceived restraints, running down stairs and spinning on a step to try to break free. After the hallucinations subsided, they felt normal again but laughed at their reaction to the experience.

In a second attempt with similar surroundings but different music, the participant experienced similar visual hallucinations of rivers forming from the keyboard. They tried to type to an online friend, causing singing to occur, and then stopped the song, which caused everything to freeze. The participant eventually shook off this frozen state as well.

The experience was described as more intense due to being intoxicated with multiple substances simultaneously."
1206,24485,"The participant initially tried smoking a small amount of the substance but did not experience significant effects beyond enhanced shininess of objects around them. They then chewed a larger quantity, which also produced only mild effects lasting about 20 minutes. Finally, they smoked two large hits in quick succession and experienced more pronounced hallucinations.

During this trip, the participant felt a pixie-like entity fly through their head and into the ceiling, where it transformed into a stream of light on the ceiling. The entity appeared upset because something had been taken from it. The participant followed the entity to their room, feeling as if their head was moving along a predetermined path in space.

Upon reaching the room, they saw more pixie-like entities forming a rainbowish stream across the ceiling and introducing them to what seemed like a god, which took the form of a tree ruling over the forest. The participant then realized this entity was actually their lamp. This experience lasted about two minutes before the effects quickly wore off.

The participant then took two more hits in the same manner as before. They heard their thoughts as if they were music playing in their head and saw these thoughts as tangible objects spreading across the ceiling and flowing down the closet door, pooling around where they lay on the floor. Closing their eyes, the pooled thoughts turned into a kaleidoscope of colors resembling bears, which then transformed into 3D geometric shapes, mostly cubes, that decomposed and fell apart before the effects wore off again."
1207,24604,"The individual began by smoking several small cigarettes containing the substance. Initially, they experienced a sensation of someone else's dream from an earlier era, described as calm and passive. As they continued, they entered a deeper meditative state, feeling fully present and empty of thoughts. They felt a connection to their brain, experiencing it as if awakening dormant circuits.

At the peak of the experience, the individual visualized themselves growing like a flower with intricate internal structures and sunflowers for eyes. This visualization was accompanied by a physical sensation of being inside their head, clean and lubricated. A strange entity then appeared in the room, seemingly occupying the user's mind or pretending to be it. The entity felt paranoid and possessive, wanting to remain hidden behind the individual.

The experience began to fade as the person became distracted by external stimuli like TV and thirst, and movement caused the effects to diminish further."
1208,13096,"The participant sat on their bed and smoked an extract, experiencing intense visual hallucinations. Their dorm room transformed into a city street at night with metal fences and street lights. They observed ten people walking in the same direction, all wearing similar tan coats and keeping their heads down. One black male made eye contact before the vision dissolved back to reality. The furniture and room twisted out of view and returned to normal states as the experience ended."
1209,12747,"The individual sat on their bed and smoked a bowl of an unidentified substance, experiencing mild euphoria and lightheadedness within 10 seconds. They were instructed to lie down by someone present. Upon closing their eyes, they found themselves at the base of a large white castle with green grass and a blue sky. A laughing fit ensued when their pillow appeared to run away, growing six legs and attempting to escape.

The individual then focused on getting across a moat in front of the castle. Two gnomes with tall red hats called out their name but did not bother them. They were pulled into the castle by red cords tied around their wrists, ankles, and knees. After about 7 minutes, they returned to reality, though still heard voices arguing in the corridor which they attributed to people in another room.

The experience concluded with a sensation of floating through various landscapes before returning to their bed. The entire trip lasted approximately 7 minutes but felt much longer to the participant."
1210,27795,"The participant began by sitting on a couch in a dimly lit basement and then experienced an altered state after consuming a substance. They found themselves outdoors in a universe with unnatural colors, feeling like a child playing in a front yard with colored grass and sky. A friendly female being was present during this time.

After some playtime, the participant was called inside by a stern male being to what felt like a grocery store. The male being led them to a counter where they were given the choice of different realities to return to. The participant felt their current reality was insignificant compared to these other options and eventually returned to the couch in the basement.

The experience included interactions with two entities: a friendly female being outdoors and a stern male being inside what seemed like a grocery store."
1211,39273,"The participant experienced intense physical effects including a sense of gravity, tingling body, raised temperature, and confusion after consuming an extract. They reported visual hallucinations of spinning colors and auditory distortions that included indistinct roars and screams. The individual perceived their friends as other beings attempting to trap them in the room, leading to feelings of intense fear.

The participant attempted to escape by standing up and walking but was instructed to sit back down. As the experience progressed, they regained some clarity and began to recognize objects in the room again. Physical symptoms included profuse sweating and slurred speech. The friends present noted that the participant became paranoid and tried to grab a burning incense stick before attempting to leave the room.

The trip lasted approximately 5 minutes during which the participant was unable to communicate clearly, only managing to say ""Match"" and ""Cross."" They were eventually brought back to reality by their friends' instructions."
1212,36639,"The participant arrived at a friend's house in the early afternoon with their cousin Brett. They were given a potent dose of an extract and smoked it all at once. As they lay back, the room began to move away from them, forming a spiral around them. The participant felt as if they had been swallowed by a dark void with strong gravity, making them feel like they were falling vertically.

Memories appeared in front of them, allowing glimpses into past experiences. An entity was encountered but did not respond when asked how to get out. The participant fell back into the spiral and saw memories passing by as if flipping through pages of a book. They reached for Michael's arm with their mind and pulled themselves back partially.

Brett reported that during the experience, the participant had a blank stare and tried to get off the bed but was helped up by Michael. Upon returning to normalcy after about 16 minutes, the participant felt hazy and shared their experience, comparing it to an alien abduction or traveling to the center of existence."
1213,23916,"The participant began experiencing visual distortions after consuming an extract for about 30 minutes. They then smoked a gram of the substance in three large inhalations. Approximately two minutes later, they experienced tunnel vision and found themselves at a creek where two beings (a man and woman) were filling a boat with unidentified items. The beings communicated among themselves in incomprehensible words but conveyed understandable meanings. They discussed how the participant could see them and debated whether to leave or stay still. The male being suggested that another entity would soon arrive, and they decided to depart. The smaller figure appeared briefly before the two left in the boat. The participant felt frightened and tried to communicate with the beings, but their words came out as gibberish. They heard a response indicating that another entity would be there soon and that humans could not stay once seen by these entities. After four minutes, the experience ended abruptly, leaving the participant staring at an alarm clock. Physical effects included sweating and a slight pulling sensation on the body. The aftereffects lasted about 20 minutes before subsiding."
1214,47928,"The user describes their first three experiences with an unnamed substance. In the initial attempt, they smoked six joints but felt only mild effects including profuse sweating. The second experience involved using a pipe, which produced stronger sensations such as blurry vision, light flashes, heavy arms, and sticky throat. During this session, the user's sister briefly interacted with them before the effects subsided. In the third attempt, three hits through a pipe resulted in intense sweating, a sensation of being pulled down, and visual hallucinations of naked humans slithering away from a Greek temple-like structure painted transparent red."
1215,12633,"During the experience, the participant encountered several entities through visualizations in Winamp software. These entities appeared to be conscious beings, not fixed in shape but rather fractal or faceted, reflecting a single being yet also distinct individuals with similar intentions. They seemed to work together as a team and were persistent in urging the participant to follow them somewhere.

The first three encounters with these entities had been friendly, but this time they became more insistent and even forceful. One entity tried to pull the participant through the music, another through their vision, and one appeared like a gas surrounding the space around the participant, exerting pressure to move them elsewhere. The participant resisted strongly due to fear of not being able to resist their will.

The room and screen visuals became alive and seemed made of consciousness rather than solid matter. This was an intense experience that lasted until the effects began to fade. Afterward, the participant reflected on the nature of reality and perception, considering these entities as real aspects of a different perspective opened by altering brain chemistry."
1216,28665,"The experience began after inhaling a substance from a bamboo bong. Initially, the participant found themselves in a room similar to their own, where they encountered two individuals: one familiar (Phil) and another unknown woman. The participant noted that the date on a calendar was marked as ""Salvia World."" Phil then commented, ""What Cameron? You're stuck in salvia,"" which triggered an intense sensation of being pushed through a mental body.

This led to a loop of repetitive thoughts where the participant felt trapped in a cycle of jumping up and down, believing they were buried in something. The experience was described as mentally exhausting and fear-inducing, with no escape from this state. When Phil intervened, the participant experienced intense emotions such as anticipation, anxiety, and hate.

Upon returning to reality, the participant found themselves back in their room but felt trapped within a mental construct of the space. They attempted to leave the room multiple times but returned each time, feeling imprisoned by their thoughts. The physical world appeared distorted, with everything looking ""squared"" or having an unusual dimensionality.

The trip concluded with the participant drinking soda and interacting briefly with parents before returning to their room, where normalcy resumed. Phil reported that during the jumping phase, the participant was moving around hysterically and was completely dissociative, unable to be reached."
1217,35247,"The narrator and a friend took an unspecified substance together outdoors. The friend experienced dizziness and reported hearing a voice that said, ""Just do what you want,"" before it vanished. After this, the narrator felt disappointed as they did not experience any effects. Later in the evening, another friend joined them with crushed pills of another substance, which affected only the second friend."
1218,50541,"The individual began by using Salvia, experiencing a strong physical sensation of their body sinking into the lounge chair. They had a vivid hallucination of being on an Amazon river boat, finding it difficult to speak due to their throat closing over as they tried to talk. The person then felt detached from their body and saw themselves in green water on the floor of the garage. This led to a state of paranoia similar to that experienced during a bad mushroom trip.

After leaving the house for dinner, no effects remained by 9 pm. They then consumed Damiana tea and smoked Damiana herb later that night. The Damiana use resulted in mild euphoria and increased sensitivity to touch, making it difficult to maintain an erection during self-gratification attempts."
1219,26735,"The individual began experiencing intense physical sensations after inhaling the substance. They described feeling as if their body was being molded into an L shape by a smooth, spiked object. Following this, they lost consciousness and felt transported to another place where they perceived themselves sitting in ice cream with a splitting sensation on their head.

In this altered state, the individual observed a plastic-like world where a woman and her child were repeatedly pushing a stroller up and down the street. Concurrently, they heard laughter from others but became angry and scared as a result. Upon regaining consciousness, the participant felt an intense pins-and-needles sensation across their body, accompanied by the feeling of small hands pulling at their skin.

This experience lasted approximately half an hour before returning to reality. The individual reported being extremely frightened during subsequent uses, believing everyone was out to get them while high."
1220,46935,"The participant experienced multiple doses of an unspecified substance. The first dose caused intense physical sensations including feeling weightless and moving at high speeds while lying on the bed. There was confusion about the environment and one's body, with the room appearing unfamiliar. After opening their eyes, they saw darkness with some shapes but did not see a specific entity often mentioned by others.

During the second dose, there were further distortions in perception. The participant felt disconnected from their limbs, as if they were too long or short and not connected to the body. They also experienced a sense of being outside their own body, likening it to renting a human body from a booth at an amusement park. There was confusion about what they were inside and where they were.

The experience left the participant feeling disconnected from their body in a positive way, with a sense of wonder and enjoyment despite the strange sensations."
1221,19057,"The participant began their experience by smoking an unknown substance in a public area near a lake at night. They reported feeling as though they had entered a world where beings much older and wiser than themselves were aware of their presence. These beings seemed to view the participant as a child playing in their yard, with a tone of concern but not worry.

The environment transformed into a cartoon-like dream landscape, with reality appearing shallowly separated from an exaggerated stage. The participant felt like they needed to move on and made their way towards the lake shore, experiencing difficulty in movement and noise. Upon reaching the water's edge, they noticed geese honking and perceived this as a sign of returning to reality.

A light turned on behind them, and the participant reached out mentally to suggest that it was not the time for someone to investigate. A shadow revealed itself to be a cat rather than a person. As the experience progressed, the cartoon-like environment gradually returned to normal reality, and the participant walked home feeling like they had experienced a profound interaction with entities."
1222,23120,"The individual experienced visual and auditory hallucinations after smoking a small dose of Salvia. They perceived a large machine resembling a ferris wheel rolling slowly from right to left across their body while lying on the sofa. The machine was occupied by human-like entities, including a male entity in the center and several female entities operating it. These entities appeared to be urgently trying to facilitate a transition between realities or dimensions as the machine passed over the individual. As the machine moved across them, the participant's head involuntarily turned from left to right, suggesting a physical sensation of being pulled into another reality. After the effects subsided, the individual conversed with the entities on the other side, expressing gratitude and a willingness to explore this experience further in the future."
1223,33472,"The individual began their experience by smoking a small bowl of cannabis at 10:30 PM and another larger bowl at 11:00 PM. At 11:25 PM, they inhaled a quarter gram of an extract mixed with cannabis. Within 20 seconds, they felt a strange sensation of gravity and lay down on the floor. They experienced difficulty breathing as if each breath was being sucked into the earth.

The individual then saw rapidly moving images before opening their eyes to look at trees. A figure of alien nature appeared and morphed into a Mazatec ceremony where people were partaking in an activity and dancing beside a fire. The ceremony ceased, replaced by the head of Medusa with snakes moving in a circular pattern. An image flashed showing their legs turning to stone, but they remained aware that it was not real.

They heard a voice telling them to turn over, which allowed them to move again. Closing their eyes revealed clouds pulling apart and an image of heaven. The experience began to wane by 11:59 PM when the individual sat in a chair and thought and spoke occasionally while still under influence."
1224,20028,"The participant began the experience by smoking a substance, immediately feeling as though they were being flipped across the room in the shape of plastic gingerbread men. This sensation was accompanied by uncontrollable laughter. After opening their eyes, the process repeated itself. In the second phase, while sitting next to a Christmas tree, the individual felt pokes all over their body and perceived themselves transforming into a Christmas tree with ornaments. They described feeling uncomfortable but also amused by this transformation."
1225,16363,"The narrator and a group of friends gathered at a friend's house where they initially consumed marijuana. Later, the narrator provided some 10X salvia extract to others in the group. One person experienced uncontrollable laughter after consuming two hits, while another consumed the entire bowl in one hit and began babbling about something before going into a bedroom with his girlfriend.

Feeling apprehensive but curious, the narrator decided to try the substance himself. The taste of the smoke was harsh and unpleasant. After inhaling, he felt intense vibrations and an overwhelming sensation described as sitting in hardening tar. His hands were shaking uncontrollably, and he had difficulty moving his legs.

The narrator experienced visual distortions, including a perception that the ceiling was actually the floor. He also noticed flashing lights in his vision. The group moved to another room to avoid disturbing others. In this new environment, the narrator became entranced by some seeds being played with by one of his friends. His memory then becomes fragmented, and he recalls bits and pieces such as laying on a bean bag, playing with a cat, and watching a movie."
1226,35443,"The individual began their night with Damiana, experiencing increased energy and tingling sensations. They then smoked Salvia, leading to a vivid hallucination where they observed a childhood park scene transform into a surreal journey through space aboard an overhang carrying people. The overhang moved back and forth through darkness, making loud electrical pops each time it shifted locations. It eventually landed on the back of a dog, with the people on board moving as the dog scratched its back. This experience highlighted interconnectedness between childhood places, travel, darkness, light, and the dog's hair.

Upon returning to reality, the individual was laughing uncontrollably and found amusement in sharing their experience with two friends who also tried Salvia. One friend experienced no effects from four bowls but noted that the rain seemed slower and they couldn't stop laughing. The other friend took one hit and became frightened, unable to cross a doorway due to perceived lines blocking his path. He described being in another world while the others were outside it.

The individual reported lingering effects including enhanced dreams with vivid details, perception of auras around everyday items without effort, and an overall sense of relaxation and reduced stress."
1227,10202,"The participant had an intense experience after smoking a substance from a large bowl containing five leaves. They felt as though they entered an additional field of existence while remaining aware of their surroundings. The individual believed they could step into a TV screen and exist on the other side, suggesting future technology might allow such travel.

When looking at their friend, the participant perceived another dimension around them, similar to being enveloped in latex rubber. They felt close to touching their friend's soul but struggled to convey this experience due to the effects of the substance wearing off. The evening continued with MDMA and further smoking sessions, combining small amounts of the initial substance with THC, which enhanced mental wandering."
1228,17386,"The individual began by smoking an unnamed substance along with cannabis in a darkened garage. As the effects set in, they experienced increased body warmth and visual distortions. Their vision curved around them, focusing on the windows of the room which appeared as segments of white glass with burgundy-pink metal frames. These elements formed an image resembling a giant vanilla cake, into which the participant felt pulled by a gravitational-like force. The sensation was that of being inside the cake where a piece had been removed and then reforming around them.

The visual experience transitioned to a state of blackness, giving way to a feeling of falling through empty space without any sense of direction or surroundings. Upon returning from this state, the participant found themselves still in their original position despite the perceived movement during the experience."
1229,14725,"The individual smoked the substance outside and experienced enhanced hearing, perceiving sounds from great distances. They could understand the speech of birds, trees, ground, and wind, which initially praised Christ but then expressed confusion about the participant's ability to comprehend them. The birds communicated fear and suspicion as the participant moved, with one bird chirping loudly in response to movement and another questioning if the participant had come to destroy them. The wind calmed these creatures.

Closing their eyes, the individual saw creatures in darkness that were wise but not evil. They observed mounds of sand forming into eye lids which opened to reveal orange cat eyes of fire belonging to a wise beast that growled without anger. Other visual hallucinations included a door opening into an electric garden and a lamp. Throughout the experience, the participant felt as if their body had become nature."
1230,24589,"The individual reported losing consciousness immediately after smoking the substance. They perceived reality as an enormous book from which they were separated, allowing them to view their entire life as pages within it. The experience included a sensation of death, where everything known was considered fiction and part of an elaborate distraction created by some supreme force. This led to feelings of being trapped in a dark cartoon-like depiction of death, with the participant's life dissolving before them.

During this state, the individual thrashed about in their chair, repeatedly saying ""no, no, no."" They attempted to stand but fell to the floor, injuring their shin and knocking over a house plant. After regaining some lucidity, they moved outside to the porch while still experiencing residual effects of the trip. The entire experience lasted approximately five minutes."
1231,14815,"The individual met with two friends at another friend's house late at night to smoke a substance. They immediately began smoking after arriving in the garage. As soon as they started inhaling, the participant felt their head fall back and experienced strong feelings of deja-vu. The visual field became filled with bright white rips in time and space, along with images described as ""electronic hell."" The participant spoke nonsense and told friends not to smoke more because it would cause the cats to stop existence. They also instructed a friend named Lucas to stay on grandma's porch, believing they were outside during daytime in 1976 when in reality they were inside past midnight."
1232,14796,"The participant and a friend smoked an extract of Salvia divinorum. The participant did not enter a trance state but experienced a change in consciousness without closing their eyes. They felt a subtle alteration in perception. Their friend, who is smaller in stature, described feeling a strong pulling sensation akin to being lifted by a forklift stuck in their head.

Both individuals reported lingering aftereffects following the experience. The participant noted an increased appreciation and awareness of plants and trees, as well as an emotional shift from depression to happiness and peace."
1233,21561,"The experience began in the master bedroom of a cabin located on a bluff overlooking the ocean. After consuming the substance through a homemade bong named ""Doctor Mario,"" one friend entered a lucid half-dreaming state. The participant then took several hits and experienced flying through a solar system, eventually landing on an earth-like planet where they became a god, creating towns, villages, and buildings. This deity-like experience lasted approximately 15 minutes.

The next day, the group went to the beach. The participant consumed the substance again near sunset and walked into knee-deep water, clapping rhythmically for about 20 minutes. During this time, they perceived sunbeams forming bridges and walkways leading into their eyes and onto the water's surface. Another friend joined them in the water, also experiencing a strong trip, and their trips merged together."
1234,24956,"Three friends gathered at a house to use an unidentified substance. S took two hits from a plastic pipe but experienced minimal effects due to short inhalation time. A then took 2-3 hits and reported feeling extremely aware of corners, smiling throughout. The narrator took several hits, holding the smoke for about 25 seconds. They felt as if they were being pushed back into their chair while experiencing strong gravity. The ceiling appeared to be an old wooden fence from a previous home, perceived sideways with the narrator's head parallel to the ground and in the center of an imagined wrought iron table.

After laughing intensely, the effects began to wear off. The group moved to another room where the narrator felt they might wake up somewhere else, experiencing humor and surrealism."
1235,11518,"The participant inhaled a substance at 0600 in the morning after working night shift and battling a head cold. Upon inhalation, they experienced a full-body sensation likened to being on a spinning Ferris wheel, with images appearing bent vertically around them as if part of a slow-moving slideshow. The experience included a feeling of numbness in the genital area while walking.

The participant's neighbor's cat joined them during this period, which was unusual for that hour. After about 20 minutes, the effects diminished enough to allow normal daily tasks. The next day, they experienced dull pain in their lower back near the liver and kidney area, lasting approximately 12 hours before resolving with over-the-counter medication."
1236,37722,"The participant prepared and consumed a brew made from a foot length of thick cactus, which caused nausea initially but led to intoxication after about one hour. They experienced vivid primary colors and proper hallucinations rather than optical effects (OEVs). The physical sensation was characterized by a high body load and limited mobility.

During the trip, the participant engaged in introspection, reflecting on masculinity and its role in their life. They felt that aggressive masculinity is necessary and perhaps they were over-sensitive to it due to personal insecurities. Later, around eight hours into the experience, the participant smoked marijuana, which facilitated easy conversation.

Towards the end of the journey, the participant consumed salvia extract, leading to a brief loss of awareness and confusion about their gender identity. This was described as an unexpected and insightful moment. The trip lasted until late morning, with the participant feeling wired and like a ""denizen of the universe"" before finally sleeping at 2 PM."
1237,11602,"The participant and their friend prepared for a sacred encounter in a tree fort, lighting a candle and offering prayers before inhaling an unnamed substance. After two inhalations, the participant felt a prickling sensation across their skin. Closing their eyes, they experienced complex visual hallucinations of red bulls running in intricate patterns.

These visions were followed by the appearance of an enormous brick wall stretching infinitely in all directions. The participant then found themselves floating above their body, observing both the wall and their friend from this elevated perspective. Suddenly, the vision changed, and the friend appeared transformed into a Native American shaman with a full feathered headdress.

The participant's friend communicated that they had witnessed a force pushing the participant to the ground before exiting through the door of the fort. After the experience ended, both participants felt their egos significantly diminished."
1238,36579,"The participant and their girlfriend were in a small bathroom during Hurricane Francis when they tried a substance purchased from a local smoke shop. The girlfriend experienced intense laughter and discomfort before lying down. The participant then smoked the entire contents of a bowl through an ice-cooled water pipe, leading to a black void where they felt like an entity without physical form. An entity appeared beside them, attempting communication but causing confusion and panic as the participant was trapped in a loop of trying to escape and being pulled back.

After what seemed like 10 minutes, the entity became clearer and was identified as the friend who had been taking care of the participant. The violent spinning led to feeling pushed back into their body, where they came to in the living room with head leaned against the wall. They were responsive but not themselves, walking slowly and yelling 'Oh my god!' before banging their head against the wall. Upon regaining normal consciousness, the participant felt mildly irritable and had difficulty recalling the experience until dreaming about it later that night."
1239,35059,"The participant experienced three distinct phases after consuming an unspecified substance. In the first phase, they felt as if they were in a cave-like environment with strong physical sensations, including all muscles being forced to one side and feeling the weight of the moon on their face. They laughed during this period before returning to relaxation.

In the second phase, plants appeared to come alive, inhaling and exhaling along with musical beats from jazz music playing in the background. The participant joined the plants in dancing, smiling throughout.

The third phase involved encountering multiple entities described as triangles within a woven cotton sheet. These entities were engaged in human behaviors such as creating, destroying, lying, deceiving, and cheating. The participant attempted to communicate with one of these entities but was met with quick laughter before beginning to retreat home. They closed their eyes to bring the entities back but chose to keep them open instead.

Upon returning to reality, there was a brief period of panic followed by calmness as the experience concluded."
1240,10144,"The participant inhaled smoke from a small amount of material and experienced rapid heartbeat shortly after inhalation. They reported telepathic communication with an entity that became clearer over time. This entity was perceived as female, beautiful but not sexy. The participant felt 'pulled' into a room where the entity resided. The entity communicated that it was not yet the right time for the participant to be there and nearly pushed them out of the room. Upon opening their eyes, the experience ended."
1241,8294,"The participant began their journey by consuming an unspecified substance through a homemade water bong. They immediately felt a strong energy wave and lost sense of self-identity. Visual distortions replaced their living room with fractal patterns of leaves and vines in an infinite spiral. The participant experienced the sensation of being part of this spiraling pattern, accompanied by tingling sensations throughout their body. Trillions of small eyes were observed within the vine-like structures, which seemed to be observing the participant without hostility.

After a brief period, the room began to materialize again, and the participant realized they had consumed Salvia. They closed their eyes and continued the experience, during which thousands or trillions of thoughts raced through their mind. The music playing in the background became prominent, guiding the journey as if breaking the participant into singular atoms and immersing them in a realm of energy/frequency.

The experience was overwhelming but not frightening, with no movement from the participant throughout. After several more mild moments, they turned on a light to regain focus."
1242,8381,"The participant smoked two hits of an unidentified substance through a homemade bong around noon. Initially, they felt disoriented about their identity and surroundings. They then experienced a vivid hallucination where people's faces appeared as dots on dominos, with the black parts representing human bodies bent to fit. These dominos were falling in a chain, and the participant was caught up in this sequence, accompanied by continuous laughter. The participant started laughing along but did not know what to do.

After this experience, they attempted to regain control of their mind but found it difficult. Their room appeared completely altered. They only had one significant hallucination (the domino experience) before regaining some control. However, the realization of how strange and intense the experience was persisted. The participant expressed concern about potential long-term effects on mental health.

During the comedown phase, they felt uncomfortable and unnerved, walking around their apartment in search of a comfortable place to sit but unable to find one."
1243,9644,"The individual experienced their soul being torn apart and then reassembled. A shadow entity appeared above them, which they attempted to communicate with but was dismissive of their presence. The experience lasted approximately five minutes during which time the participant laughed uncontrollably at a TV program. They tried to reconnect with the shadow entity after the initial encounter but were unsuccessful."
1244,8433,"The participant, who is experienced with psychoactive substances, consumed a large dose of an unnamed substance. Within 10 seconds of inhalation, they began to experience visual distortions and lost contact with their immediate surroundings while remaining conscious. A male entity appeared behind them, beckoning the individual to follow ""out with all the scenery."" The entity communicated through a Phil Collins song that played in the participant's mind, encouraging them to go home.

The participant felt a strong pull from the center of their shoulder blades towards the entity and perceived lush green fields with split-rail fences on either side. They were ecstatic about this experience but did not know how to return once they came back to reality. The overlap between realities was described as a double-exposed photograph, where elements of both experiences coexisted.

The male entity was sensed rather than seen or heard and communicated through vivid feelings and emotions. The participant believed that they accessed a different vibrational level of existence without physically moving from their location."
1245,8276,"The participant began by taking a dose of a substance, experiencing initial physical sensations such as burning and dampness around their eyes. They felt a wave of selflessness spreading through their body, leading to a state where they were almost petrified, with only the nerves in their mouth retaining any sensation. Using a specific breathing technique, they entered an altered state of consciousness, feeling detached from their ego and connected to a larger, timeless existence.

After a period of this heightened awareness, the participant was brought back to reality by a cough. They then experienced vivid sensations outside, finding beauty in nature but also feeling disconnected from societal norms. The natural world seemed alive with sounds and colors, while interactions with neighbors made them feel out of place. The experience concluded with the participant reflecting on their journey and the insights gained."
1246,8820,"The participant experimented with making their own extract of a substance and took two hits through a waterpipe. They experienced extreme disorientation immediately after the first hit. Visual hallucinations included rivers of color on the ceiling and an ocean briefly forming there. The participant felt unable to move freely but remained somewhat conscious.

During the trip, they perceived their room as unfamiliar yet recognized it as their own space. A dark ball of light appeared in the room, initially thought to be a friend but later realized was not present. This entity may have represented the participant's subconscious or a warning about being alone during the experience.

The trip peaked after two hits and gradually subsided, leaving the participant shocked by the intensity of the effects."
1247,8654,"The individual consumed an unspecified substance and felt transported to another universe where they perceived no free will and experienced the world as a series of choices shared by others. They could remember their sober life but realized it was just this reality without awareness. The experience involved seeing everything with a pronounced curve, feeling the physicality and tangibility of the surroundings, and occasionally remembering an old saying about getting lost in infinity when two people join hands. During the trip, they interacted briefly with their friend who acted as a sitter, expressing confusion and fear. Upon returning to normal consciousness, the individual experienced difficulty readjusting and had lingering thoughts about the nature of reality."
1248,9036,"The participant smoked an unknown substance twice, first from a tobacco pipe and then from a water pipe while in a dimly lit setting with music playing. After the second inhalation, they experienced a tingling sensation across their body followed by a feeling that their skin was turning into leaves and they were becoming a tree. They became immersed in a separate reality of their own creation. When their friend started tripping, he saw his reflection as people going somewhere and asked where they were going. The participant felt confusion upon returning to normal consciousness, describing it as the feeling of being born."
1249,32345,"A participant experienced their first encounter with an unknown substance. They consumed a large dose and immediately began laughing hysterically for about one minute while drooling uncontrollably. After this initial reaction, they sat back mumbling incoherently for another minute before attempting to stand up, which resulted in them falling back onto the couch twice. Upon standing successfully, they staggered into the kitchen, repeating phrases like ""What the fuck..."" and looking around wildly.

In the kitchen, the participant started yelling ""WHERE IS SHE?"" while making frantic hand motions. When asked who ""She"" was by a friend, the response was repeated yelling of ""WHERE IS SHE?"" The participant then looked towards the ceiling and screamed ""NO!"" in a whiny tone when asked if it referred to their mother or the cats. After this episode, they walked back to the couch, sat down calmly, and asked what had just happened.

The entire experience lasted approximately 6-7 minutes, but the participant only remembered smoking the substance and then being in the kitchen screaming before sitting back down."
1250,32121,"The participant had a first encounter with an unnamed substance that did not produce noticeable effects. Two weeks later, they tried it again in a deserted schoolyard setting. After inhaling two large doses, visual distortions began within 2-3 minutes. The surroundings appeared as if viewed from above and then zoomed into the immediate vicinity. Everything around was perceived as multicolored tubes forming patterns that represented reality. Relaxing against the door caused these tubes to flow into the participant's body, creating a sense of connection with everything around them. This experience lasted about two hours and left an enduring positive feeling for 2-3 days afterward."
1251,17816,"The participant sat in a comfortable living room with friends and took two hits from a bong containing leaves. After exhaling, they felt their body become heavy and their vision became cloudy, similar to walking through a rainstorm. They experienced a sensation of being pushed by an invisible force on the left side of their body.

As their perception shifted, they saw their friends transform into replicas of family members from childhood. The participant gained insights into relationships and began piecing together answers to personal questions. Their vision then blurred into geometric shapes reminiscent of Lego pieces or video game puzzles before returning to reality abruptly.

Feeling tired and groggy, the participant laid down on a bed and listened to music, experiencing it as if the words and melodies were appearing before them visually. This state lasted for about an hour before they returned to baseline."
1252,30669,"The participant began by using a small amount of the substance and experienced a slight buzz accompanied by a sense of presence. They heard voices in their mind saying ""She's coming, she's coming,"" indicating an approaching entity. 

In a subsequent session with a higher dose, they found themselves rock climbing with a female presence that could not be seen but was felt. This experience was followed by the sensation of being sucked into a hole resembling an earthquake or avalanche, though it wasn't scary.

After another hit, the participant spun in space surrounded by stars and felt a spirit-like entity flipping through scenes like pages in a book. They experienced billions of human spirits marching through them at high speed, connecting with each person's life. 

The experience concluded with floating on a river, feeling enlightened, followed by falling down Niagara Falls back into their bedroom. The participant emphasized the importance of silence and solitude for deeper experiences."
1253,9866,"The participant smoked an unspecified amount of a psychoactive substance, experiencing intense effects that lasted about 15 minutes before subsiding. During this time, they felt detached from their body and surroundings, perceiving abstract, non-verbal concepts as if in a philosophical debate. They contemplated making significant sacrifices but ultimately decided against it due to personal commitments. Upon coming down, the environment regained its previous level of recognizability after an additional 15 minutes. The participant then smoked another dose using a painting, experiencing similar effects but with less intensity when focusing on the visual aspect."
1254,26291,"The narrator and their friend W smoked an estimated 1/3 gram of a substance through a glass pipe in a secluded area of a park at around 2:30 pm. After three hits, the narrator began to feel spinning sensations and mental detachment. They entered a hallucinatory state where they saw a winding hallway filled with sweets and pink creatures engaged in various activities. The narrator was guided towards a door guarded by two stationary figures resembling candy canes who informed them that they were expected on the other side. The door itself was a swirling mass of bright colors. During this experience, W shouted 'YOU ARE INFINITE!' before the trip ended abruptly when W asked where the substance was."
1255,16954,"The participant and a friend used an unnamed substance in a head shop setting. They smoked two bowls from a hookah, experiencing immediate effects after the first bowl. A gripping sensation affected the top half of the body, particularly the chin, making the participant feel as though their jaw would melt off. Hands felt bonded to the table despite not being physically attached. The effect lasted about a minute and was accompanied by sweating.

They smoked again, this time with only one hit needed. The table appeared to be moving like a conveyor belt under the participant's hands while people around them seemed normal but unaware of the table's motion. This led to uncontrollable laughter that subsided as the effects wore off.

For a third attempt, they took several heavy hits and held the smoke in longer. A violent presence was felt with mocking voices criticizing their decision to use the substance. The gripping sensation returned, moving downward from the face. The participant moved away from the table, associating it with unhappy spirits. Their friend described the effects to others nearby, briefly causing fear before rationalizing that he wasn't endorsing the drug.

The heavy fear and voices lasted about 45-60 seconds but felt much longer. Overall, the experience was not pleasant due to the mocking anger and anxious paranoia."
1256,7950,"The participant and a friend went to a park at night to consume an extract of a substance. After inhaling the substance, the participant felt intense inebriation almost immediately. They experienced a collapse into two dimensions initially but then everything regained depth, with the sky appearing as an arched bridge lit by fireflies. The participant felt disconnected from reality and alone, more like a self-aware being in an empty place than human. Physical effects included profuse sweating to the point of soaking through clothes despite not feeling extremely hot.

The friend also consumed the substance later, leading them both to run around and act erratically. They repeated this experience at the friend's house with others present, which resulted in a confrontation with the friend's mother. The participant found the experience insightful but challenging due to difficulty interacting with others while under its influence."
1257,27619,"The participant observed another individual using Salvia Divinorum. After inhaling the substance, the subject's muscles relaxed, their breathing became regular and sounded like snoring, and their eyes flickered rapidly under closed eyelids. The subject found it difficult to describe their experience but did not compare it to a dream."
1258,15998,"The participant consumed an extract from Salvia leaves through a bong at a friend's house. They experienced immediate intoxication characterized by a strong feeling of power and fear. Their speech felt controlled as if by external forces. The environment appeared to transform into a tube-like structure, causing intense pressure without pain. As the tube spun rapidly, objects in the room shifted positions erratically. After a jarring sensation, the surroundings returned to normal. The experience lasted about eight minutes, followed by twenty minutes of detachment and mild high."
1259,18520,"The individual began to feel disoriented after taking several hits of an unknown substance. They felt as if they were spinning rapidly and had difficulty moving around their apartment, eventually lying down due to increasing disorientation. Physical sensations included feeling like a train was running over them from feet to head while in a raised position.

Hallucinations followed quickly, including seeing themselves outside the apartment within a strange yellowish force field. They perceived being with many people who seemed to be boarding some form of transportation, possibly a bus. The individual heard voices speaking directly to them and felt the presence of both male and female entities nearby. There was confusion about whether they were thinking or saying certain phrases aloud.

Visual hallucinations included seeing a windmill-like object above them that resembled something from a video game, as well as experiencing the room rotating around them with orange-green colors at the edges. The trip ended abruptly, leaving lingering effects such as occasional visual disturbances and perceived movement in the sky when looking up on clear days."
1260,8571,"The participant had three separate experiences with an unnamed substance. The first two attempts resulted in minimal effects, but on the third attempt, they felt as though they were merging with the couch they were sitting on for about two minutes. During this period, they communicated their experience to a sitter who was present.

In another part of the experience, after smoking more of the substance, the participant reported seeing an entire story unfold in their mind at a rapid pace while lying down with their eyes closed. Later, when smoking the substance again with a friend on a porch around 3 AM, they experienced uncontrollable laughter and crying. They perceived their shadow as a separate person during this time.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling satisfied and gaining respect for the substance's effects."
1261,7346,"The participant began by taking a small amount of an odorless, dark green substance and felt minimal effects. Later, they took a larger dose, leading to immediate visual hallucinations with swirling colors in reds and yellows. They perceived giant machines cycling across the land, threatening destruction, and felt compelled to escape their path.

The participant then entered an unconscious state, experiencing music instructing them to leave the house. Confused and disoriented, they attempted to put on a belt before running outside without shoes or socks in cold weather. Upon regaining consciousness near the door, they realized they had smoked the substance.

Returning inside, they saw rivers flowing through walls and patterns of spirits and eyes appearing in their vision. They could manipulate objects visually, such as making the TV morph into part of the wall. The comedown was itchy and hot, leading them to remove all clothing and feel uncomfortable with new clothes on."
1262,7289,"The participant prepared an unnamed substance in a bong and smoked two large bowls. They experienced rapid onset effects within seconds of inhaling the second bowl. The user reported feeling as though time had stopped and their perception shifted inward, making everything seem like a movie or TV screen. Their arms looked strange and they felt disconnected from their body.

The experience intensified quickly, causing confusion about identity and surroundings. The participant saw an artificial, cartoonish version of what appeared to be a darkened street while sitting on the edge of a mattress in their room. Walls were not visible, creating a sense of endless space. Layers and puzzle-like patterns overlay everything seen.

Amnesia briefly set in, with the user struggling to remember basic information like their own name. Small entities were felt but not seen, causing fear that they might appear at any moment. The participant laid down on the mattress and observed undulating room visuals when looking up at the ceiling. With eyes closed, reddish tinted patterns were seen, including a wheel of five connected people.

As the experience subsided after about 45 minutes, the user felt slightly wobbly but was able to think clearly again. A slight headache remained afterward."
1263,7310,"The participant began by smoking Wild Dagga with no noticeable effects, then moved to smoke Salvia divinorum in a darkened room. Upon inhaling a large dose, they experienced an overwhelming wave-like sensation that enveloped their body, starting from the left shoulder and moving towards the head. This caused intense fear and a feeling of ego-death, where the participant believed they had lost their physical self.

In this altered state, the environment appeared distorted with no walls and objects morphing into unfamiliar shapes. The participant attempted to regain control by moving their arms but saw only movement below them, which increased their terror. They spent much of the trip huddled under a blanket in fear, praying for it to end. After about two minutes, the effects began to subside, leaving the participant exhausted and reflecting on the experience.

The encounter with Salvia divinorum was described as life-changing, instilling a newfound respect for life and prompting a decision to make better use of their time."
1264,19884,"A 16-year-old male attempted to consume a plant he thought was Salvia by both chewing and smoking it over several sessions. He consumed approximately 3 grams of the plant material orally and about 2 grams through smoking. Despite these efforts, he did not experience any notable effects from the substance other than mild dizziness likely caused by inhaling smoke. The overall experience was uneventful, with no hallucinations or altered states reported."
1265,17978,"The participant sat down with two others and smoked an average glass bong bowl of an unnamed substance. They immediately felt intertwined with matter, such that any movement caused the surrounding landscape to move towards them. Initially in a middle-class American residential neighborhood, they experienced waves approaching from afar, causing the landscape to buckle and roll. The waves exposed layers of the neighborhood that unpeeled and reattached to various objects as they moved. Families were seen living in toy-like villages on the side of houses.

As the wave approached the participant's body, it was chopped into pieces and ploughed under. They felt a sense of insignificance and betrayal at the inevitability of the waves. The people around them appeared shocked, betrayed, and dismayed. After the wave passed through their head, they found themselves in a green jungle with many tendrils. As they began to remember themselves, they realized they were in their house, but the walls were covered in vegetation.

The experience lasted approximately six minutes and was described as overwhelming, beautiful, frightening, elaborate, and memorable."
1266,8202,"The participant had two drug trip experiences. The first attempt was in a social setting where they felt an energy force pushing them around but were unable to fully enjoy the experience due to constant questions from their friends. For the second session, conducted alone at home, the user smoked 100mg of the substance and experienced similar effects as before, including visual distortions with geometric shapes and unusual colors. After a brief period, they inhaled another 100mg, leading to an intense experience where they felt as if they were on the border between two realities. They believed this new reality was familiar but also alienating, questioning its nature as either a hallucination or a real place. The participant reported feeling overwhelmed by these thoughts and concluded that the effects of the substance were similar across users, suggesting there might be more to it than just neural chemistry."
1267,16043,"In a dimly lit room with friends present but silent, the participant smoked three cones of a substance through a bong without normal breathing. Initially, they experienced marijuana-like patterns that grew larger and moved around more. A buzzing sound was heard, similar to nitrous oxide. The participant then felt unusual body sensations and a spinning feeling.

Closing their eyes, the individual entered what felt like another place, experiencing tunnel vision with wooshy noises. They imagined being on a boat in a storm, which scared them into opening their eyes again. Re-closing their eyes, they found themselves in an open natural environment surrounded by grass. A female presence was sensed, and upon calling out ""Sally D!!!!"", the participant returned to reality.

Back in the room, gravity felt altered, pulling the individual left and right and nearly off the couch. The couch moved back and forth as if on wheels. Various faces appeared, some cartoonish or fantasy-like, others normal but overlaid with patterns or static. The participant expressed thoughts about never doing this again and the unpredictability of drugs.

The experience was intense and difficult to describe in words. Even after lights were turned on and a movie resumed, visual distortions persisted, such as blurred outlines and morphing faces. The lounge chair continued to move back and forth when the participant thought about it for up to an hour later."
1268,8905,"The individual began the experience feeling sleepy after a stressful day. Upon ingestion, they experienced slow vertigo and an expanding sensory field that included vast expanses of space and time, as well as emotions and memories. They briefly questioned whether they were asleep or experiencing drug effects. Visual scenes included outdoor landscapes with trees, hills, and buildings. The participant felt overwhelmed by emotions and a sense of cosmic understanding. There was no clear indication of the duration of peak experiences due to suspended time perception. Upon returning to normal consciousness, there was an aura of sacredness, followed by vivid but ordinary dreams."
1269,6815,"The individual inhaled smoke from a substance and experienced immediate visual distortions, noticing features forming a cartoon face on the wall. After lying down in a chair, they saw a bright spot in their vision that became more angular and larger. They then entered a state where they felt their body had no recognizable form and were laughing uncontrollably while the room appeared to spin and blur. The individual tried to communicate with friends about how far gone they were but continued to laugh until tears formed. Physical sensations, described as dull tingling pressure under the skin, became painful in some areas. As the effects faded, the person felt safe to drive 45 minutes after smoking."
1270,9820,"The participant began by placing dried, crushed leaves of Salvia splendens under their tongue for about 30 minutes. They experienced initial effects around 15 minutes later, characterized by a sense that reality was slightly altered but not fully understood. Thinking became slower and rational thought more challenging. The individual felt safe and awake, with colors appearing brighter.

After removing the leaves from their mouth due to bitterness, they dried the remaining plant material in a microwave and mixed it with cannabis sativa flower buds and leaves before smoking through a waterpipe. Lying down on a bed, they visualized two entities representing Salvia splendens and Cannabis sativa as green, leafy bushes that were aware of them. These entities communicated by 'changing thoughts' rather than speaking.

The participant asked for assistance in fighting their flu, which the entities joined in doing. The mental hallucinations occurred only when the eyes were closed; with open eyes, everything appeared normal. Concentrating on themselves amplified feelings of well-being to an extreme level, causing them to cry momentarily from pleasure. The experience lasted about 4-5 hours and was described as mild but extremely pleasurable."
1271,6278,"The user began by smoking an unknown substance and immediately felt a powerful energy passing through them. They became disoriented and experienced visual disturbances including colors and images. The user reported being transported to another place while simultaneously remaining in their room, feeling vertical but not actually moving from the bed. Three illuminated circles or entities appeared, one pulling at the other two. Two of these were tugging the user towards a portal-like presence, while the third was holding them back. The user felt apprehensive about going all the way and returned to normal quickly after the initial intense onset. They also reported seeing their sisters in the next room during the experience."
1272,5877,"The participant began by smoking a large amount of an unnamed substance using a regular pipe. Immediately after inhaling, they experienced a strong full-body sensation and closed their eyes, seeing vivid visuals of a spiral. They followed small particles into this spiral and were transported to a land where they became a plant being with a flower on their head and leaves covering their body.

In this new form, the participant worked alongside other plant beings, throwing stacks of leaves onto a wagon. After completing this task, leafy horses pulled the wagon. The participant felt rooted in place and remained there while talking about the sky with their new friends. They eventually returned to normal consciousness, feeling slightly out of it.

The participant then shared their experience with two friends who also tried the substance. One friend reported seeing dancing macaroni, while the other described floating through the sky, aware only of themselves."
1273,5761,"The individual began by observing the smoke from an inhalation device, becoming entranced with its movement. They then felt as if they were seeing everything for the first time, without prior knowledge or memory. This led to confusion about the purpose of objects around them, such as the bong used. The participant questioned their own actions and motivations, particularly why they chose to use the inhalation device.

Closing their eyes did not produce vivid imagery but instead brought a repetitive thought: ""We are all just human, and that is what we are..."" This realization filled the individual with both amazement and shock at the beauty of humanity. The experience left them contemplating the transient nature of elements like money, power, greed, and fame, which can distort one's perception of true beauty."
1274,5678,"The individual reported experiencing vivid visual imagery after consuming a substance. They saw multiple translucent entities with varying forms, including one resembling a fish and another unfamiliar creature. These entities were described as dying and passing through a membrane into a void-like space. The participant then experienced the sensation of an entity entering their mind through a hole in their head, leading to a loss of consciousness and ego. Upon regaining awareness, they encountered what appeared to be their own face, which laughed at them before fading away."
1275,10310,"The individual reported an experience where they accessed alternate dimensions and realities effortlessly. They traveled faster than the speed of light with assistance from a guide named Shagraan, described as a light being. During this journey, they observed visualizations of other planetary civilizations from a distance and encountered three global entities who were friends. The participant also saw beings that appeared to be humanoid in form but only visually. The experience was characterized by laughter and amusement at the speed of travel."
1276,5674,"The participant began by smoking a potent form of the substance in a glass pipe while setting up a calm environment with candlelight and incense. They experienced tingling sensations and a mild head buzz before hearing an internal voice, which they perceived as belonging to the plant. This entity expressed concern over the participant's casual use of the substance for recreational purposes rather than spiritual exploration.

Feeling remorseful, the participant attempted to communicate their experience online but found themselves unable to articulate it clearly. They decided to wait and try again later with a more respectful approach. In the second attempt, they experienced waves of pleasure and entered an altered state where they found themselves in a schoolyard setting from the 1930s, alongside other children who were also using the substance.

In this environment, the participant interacted with an entity resembling a schoolteacher, whom they identified as the plant. This entity conveyed that it was not angry but concerned about misuse and warned of potential punishment for future misbehavior. The experience concluded with the participant returning to their physical surroundings while feeling positive about the encounter."
1277,5463,"The experience began with slight anxiety before intensifying. The participant's girlfriend transformed into a grotesque version of Jabba the Hut, filling their entire visual field. This image was accompanied by psychedelic peeling edges of the room. Next, they found themselves in an unfamiliar bedroom with friends from high school, all behind them and aware of something the participant did not know. They felt unable to speak or understand what was happening, leading to embarrassment and discomfort.

The experience then shifted to a sense that their whole life had been leading up to this moment, similar to ""The Truman Show."" The participant remembered an old dream about a greenhouse room. After regaining some awareness of their surroundings, they walked into the hallway feeling extremely disoriented. Overall, the experience was described as comparable to the best acid trip, characterized by total ego loss and complex, paradoxical thoughts."
1278,5254,"The individual began the experience by consuming an unspecified substance while already under the influence of LSD. They quickly reached intense visual hallucinations characterized by fast-moving reddish faces shaped like scales that screamed in anguish. These entities attempted to take over their soul, causing panic and difficulty moving. The participant managed to communicate with a sober friend about what was happening despite the overwhelming experience. After an hour of shaking uncontrollably, they recovered and destroyed all remaining substance."
1279,5179,"The first trip occurred when the participant was alone at home. They smoked a significant amount of an unknown substance using a bong. After inhaling two large hits, they experienced disorientation and slipped into childhood memories. The user saw their grandparents' house and felt warm and comfortable while riding a tricycle in the driveway. Their grandfather smiled with joy as he watched them pedal around. The participant was aware that reality was shifting between play and pause states. They became scared of being discovered by their mother and forced themselves out of the trip, waking up confused on the floor.

The second trip involved the user and a friend smoking the substance in a car. After inhaling two large hits, the friend experienced intense hallucinations, feeling as though the world was peeling away and everyone would die if they stayed. The participant calmed their friend down by reassuring them that everything was okay. When it was the participant's turn to smoke, they had vivid hallucinations of a Beetle Bailey cartoon character named Soldier. The soldier instructed the participant to leave reality, feeling as though their body was being peeled away in strips. They felt coolness in their hand and face as this process continued until they snapped back into reality."
1280,4891,"The participant experienced intense visual distortions shortly after ingesting an unknown substance. Initially, they felt as if reality was unimportant and that their spirit could exist independently. Objects appeared to blend and transform, with the corner of a coffee table stretching and intertwining with other objects in the room. A girl present in the room also seemed to merge with her surroundings, with her extremities and hair growing into the environment like snakes.

The participant felt an overwhelming sense of wisdom and believed they possessed the meaning of life. They reported feeling disconnected from their physical body due to a previous neck injury that left them paralyzed. After taking another dose, the room began to distort further, with walls appearing to unzip and rezip, tilting the space around them. The girl in the room again appeared to merge with her surroundings, drawing the participant towards her.

The experience was described as intense and overwhelming, with occasional flashbacks throughout the day."
1281,4848,"The participant was at home when they felt an urge to alter reality. They decided to use a dried plant substance, which they prepared in a makeshift bong and smoked multiple times. The initial effects included physical sensations such as limbs feeling separated and a filter on perception being dropped away. As the experience progressed, the user saw various beings around them and noticed that objects in the room appeared to come alive with personalities.

The participant then focused on their spiritual purpose for using the substance and realized that adding intention to the trip helped achieve this goal. They observed that everything had energetic, determined personalities trying to fulfill their purposes. The experience was overwhelming, making it difficult to deal with all the sensory input from everyday objects.

The user also noted a change in perception of reality, seeing things as if through layers or filters. This included visualizing objects on different layers and understanding connections between them based on energy rather than physical connection."
1282,4834,"The individual smoked an uncertain dosage of a substance, likely a high dose based on previous experiences. Initially, they perceived a tunnel of people building in front of them, reminiscent of a previous journey. A female presence with a stereotypical Australian accent acted as a gameshow host, welcoming and guiding the participant through various activities that involved joining others in a machine-like structure. The individual felt reluctant to participate but continued regardless.

The experience was characterized by dual perceptions: one normal and everyday, and another surreal and vivid, seemingly beamed directly into their brain. Closing their eyes seemed to diminish the intensity of the hallucinations. After some time, the participant decided to return to normal perception but struggled with an internal conflict about letting go of the experience.

To aid in coming down from the trip, they took a cold shower, which helped bring them back slightly. Upon returning to the bedroom, they watched television and found commercials particularly absurd and entertaining. They attempted to smoke another small dose to ease their state but experienced no noticeable effects.

The overall experience was intense, uncomfortable at times, and lasted several hours before fading away with residual headache and exhaustion."
1283,3632,"The individual began their experience around 10:30pm after consuming an extract of unknown potency. They first used a lower dose which produced mild closed-eye visuals, including seeing a smiling lady's face. Following this, they consumed a higher dose and experienced rapid onset effects that left them paralyzed for about five minutes with only the mouthpiece of their pipe in their mouth. After regaining some motor function, they felt extremely disoriented and lost.

The participant reported feeling as though their consciousness had been sliced into many pieces, each flashing rapidly in vivid, dream-like sequences. They experienced a sense of losing individuality and forgetting about having a body. The experience was intense enough to cause fear and the urge to leave the room or yell out loud, but they were calmed by their friend's presence.

The trip lasted for at least 10 minutes before the participant could regain some composure. They strongly advised against further consumption of the substance due to its intensity."
1284,3836,"In the first experience, after smoking the substance, the participant heard a voice telling them to take their couch to add it to a machine being built. Upon opening their eyes, they noticed a blue tinge in the room and could hear chattery laughter. Closing their eyes again, they experienced falling past a red brick building with yellow rectangles where windows should be. This visual lasted about 30 seconds before the participant felt coldness in their mouth and hands, along with a metallic taste.

In the second experience, after smoking the substance, the participant heard a voice and then perceived entities lifting the walls of their room apart while keeping their eyes closed. These beings were not visible to the participant. Once the room was removed, they found themselves suspended in darkness until small dancing figures appeared before them."
1285,4373,"The participant first tried the substance in January 2000 with friends after drinking at bars but did not have the right mindset or technique for smoking it properly and concluded that it wasn't effective. In December 2000, they revisited the substance while preparing for a mushroom trip. They smoked two bong hits and experienced visual distortions where everything seemed two-dimensional yet floating in three dimensions. The room appeared tilted, leading to a fall. After lying down on the couch, the effects gradually wore off after about ten minutes."
1286,2997,"The participant and their friend Weazel consumed an unnamed psychedelic substance together in a homemade pipe. Within 1.5 minutes of consumption, they experienced initial disorientation and silence. The participant felt as if they were trapped in a new dimension, struggling to explore it while physically paralyzed. They saw Weazel's face distorted into a cheshire cat-like appearance with fluid colors.

The participant heard voices demanding that they relax but initially resisted. Visual hallucinations of a 'Simpsons'-like world appeared, with characters speaking gibberish and disappearing. The experience was confusing and disorienting for the participant. After the effects subsided, both participants were in a state of fazed disorientation.

Weazel reported seeing cartoon gingerbread men dancing on the dashboard during his trip, which seemed to align with the general context of the participant's experience."
1287,2991,"The participant had two experiences with a psychoactive substance. In the first instance, after inhaling the substance, they experienced a split perception of self, feeling as if their body was divided into two parts. They ran around in circles, one part moving clockwise while the other moved counterclockwise. The individual also encountered difficulty navigating through doorways and walls, with one version running through the open door while the other hit the wall beside it. During this time, they communicated via instant messaging to friends about their experience.

In the second experience, which occurred later that night, the participant inhaled a stronger form of the substance. They reported seeing their surroundings appear to dance and felt as if they were merging with trees visually and spiritually. The individual walked around laughing but holding back the laughter. A friend approached them through a twisted visual field, which lasted for about a minute before returning to normal."
1288,2942,"The participants smoked sage in a darkened room with candlelight. One participant felt numbness and experienced a presence they perceived as an entity. This entity was described as playful and receding, leaving after a brief interaction where both parties smiled and said goodbye. The other participant reported feeling tired and did not experience significant effects. After the session, the first participant reflected on the experience, realizing that the entity might have been a construct of their own mind."
1289,2736,"The participant sat down with two others to try an unnamed substance for the first time. They smoked it using a ceramic fish-head pipe with a long metal stem, which seemed ideal for burning the leaves at high temperatures without causing throat irritation. The second hit was smoother than the first and initiated the unusual experience.

During the trip, the participant felt their consciousness rolling like a TV with a screwed-up vertical-hold knob, moving through a V-shaped wedge of space from the pointed end out to infinity. Each time through, they perceived a bigger slice of reality until returning to consensus reality. They expressed discomfort during this process and wished for it to stop.

The participant's girlfriend did not enjoy the experience much, while his brother became excited after the first hit, leaping around the room and ordering more of the substance despite having difficulty processing language later on.

In a subsequent trip with the same group, the participant felt as if they were merging with a Papasan chair. They described traversing a course around the room, intersecting objects from a pinpoint perspective in time and space. The experience included three 'bumps' or rough patches that seemed to correlate with decorative wrappings on the chair.

The participant often felt like they were playing a game or being played a joke during these trips, with an urgent need to figure out the rules. They sometimes glimpsed parts of the game but did not always bring back complete information.

Music played during one trip sounded wrong and somewhat out of place, similar to a scene in ""Stir of Echoes"" where the viewer watches a character die from their perspective."
1290,2856,"The participant had two experiences with an unnamed substance. The first experience occurred at night when they inhaled the substance twice, leading to unusual physical sensations and visual hallucinations. They saw themselves sitting on doorsteps and observed a large cloud before lying down and closing their eyes.

On the second occasion, around 1 PM the next day, the participant had a more intense experience while listening to music and lying on pillows in their bathroom. They lost consciousness immediately after inhaling deeply. During this trip, they saw concentric circles of different colors with silhouettes resembling a world. They heard unfamiliar industrial-sounding music and witnessed scenes including destruction and creation.

The participant also experienced a voice explaining that humans have left nature's cycle to join a complex system of capitalism and mass production. This revelation was followed by thoughts about the complexity of the world and a desire to make changes based on these insights."
1291,11200,"While holding smoke in their lungs, the individual enters an altered state of consciousness. They feel as though they have regressed into a previous life on another planet rather than observing it as a tourist. Their body moves along an axis at their waist, and beings from various dimensions fold into them in geometrically impossible ways. These beings are connected to the participant through thought, and each fold brings a unique world with its own set of beings.

The participant questions the nature of their normal existence, finding it hard to believe that it could be their home compared to this experience. They feel reluctant to leave this new world when they sense they will have to fold into their girlfriend, who is actually in another room. The participant wonders about the concept of gender and identity, noting that the beings around them are not divided by male/female distinctions.

As the experience comes to an end, the individual reflects on the unique characteristics of their own reality, considering the vast possibilities for conscious existence."
1292,3213,"Two individuals and a new acquaintance consumed an unspecified substance, leading to intense visual hallucinations and physical sensations. Upon inhalation, one participant experienced euphoria and giggling, followed by disassociation characterized by bright purple, yellow, and orange swirls in their vision. Another participant reported feeling pulled down through the bed and saw smiley faces pulling them onto the bed. The third individual also experienced intense visual hallucinations under a lamp.

During the experience, they received a phone call from a friend who heard laughter and music. Despite being incapacitated, one of the participants managed to communicate that they were on drugs and invited their friend over. Upon arrival, the new acquaintance reported similar sensations and engaged in prolonged staring at a light source.

The group agreed that the substance caused an intense feeling of being pulled down, necessitating lying or sitting down. The experience was described as positive but very intense, with little time for introspection."
1293,2315,"The participant began by smoking an extract from a substance, placed in a bong, and then held the smoke in for as long as possible before exhaling. Initially, they experienced a loss of their usual body feeling and known geometries breaking down. They perceived large, differently shaped and colored columns that felt like new realities or aspects of themselves.

The participant reported seeing different worlds when moving their head, even with eyes closed, and had the sensation of reality collapsing and merging in various ways. At times, they thought they were in other dimensions and could not distinguish between dream-like states and actual perceptions. They also heard voices in their head but did not recall specific interactions.

The experience included physical sensations such as body twisting and feeling like two rotating discs with consciousness mapped on them. The intensity of the trip peaked within the first few minutes before gradually decreasing, allowing the participant to reconnect with their old reality through external cues like music playing in the background.

After about 10 minutes, the participant opened their eyes but remained seated for another three minutes due to the shock of the experience. They were happy to return to their normal world and found the trip very interesting, though challenging to describe or remember in detail."
1294,245,"The participant took a large dose of an extract sublingually over 12 minutes. Initially, there was a burning sensation in the mouth followed by numbness. As the substance kicked in, the individual experienced tingling sensations spreading through their body and slight visual distortions such as a fish-eyed view with green and amber-red tints.

While sitting at their computer, the display began to appear three-dimensional. The participant then stood up and felt that 'down' was to their left, perceiving themselves as standing on what should have been a wall. They entered an altered state where they believed they were in a garden rather than their room. This perception persisted even when lying down in darkness.

The individual attempted to ground themselves by walking around but found it difficult to judge time and direction accurately. While looking at a mirror, they noticed a blank expression on their face and realized they had been narrating the experience as if from an external perspective. They then perceived themselves as existing simultaneously in three forms: body, consciousness (shoulder-entity), and spectator.

The participant managed to undress and take a shower while feeling split into these three entities but gradually returned to a single entity state during the shower. By the end of the experience, they were mostly back to baseline but felt extremely awake and alert."
1295,186,"The individual began their experience by smoking a substance, feeling pressure rise from their feet to their head. After inhaling a second bowl, they felt pushed out of their body. In this state, they perceived themselves as part of the universe, spiraling downward through various levels of existence until reaching a point where there was no concept of self.

Two beings of light were encountered during the experience. The participant then became aware of knocking items off shelves but could not stop due to confusion about whether it was happening or about to happen. Upon speaking with a friend over the phone, they saw waves of color corresponding to sounds heard.

The individual felt a sense of unity with the universe and connected with their higher self, seeing life as part of an eternal journey. They emphasized the importance of not getting lost in physical experiences and treating the plant with respect."
1296,138,"The participant experienced intense physical sensations during their first encounter, feeling as though an external force was pushing them sideways. They saw three rippling waves of energy in blue and felt panic due to a loss of control. Presences appeared around the bed, and the participant called out a woman's name but could not recall who it was or what they said. The experience lasted about 15 minutes before calming down.

During their second session, with a smaller dose and closed eyes, the physical sensations were still present but manageable due to better control. They experienced audio hallucinations for some time afterward, including hearing an owl hoot and footsteps in the room."
1297,100,"The participant experienced their first encounter with an unnamed substance at around 9:45 PM. Initially, they had difficulty smoking it due to inexperience but eventually managed a few hits. The effects were mild initially, characterized by a warm feeling and pulsing sensations at the forehead and chin. After about an hour, they tried again after consuming some wine and marijuana. This time, the effects were more pronounced.

The participant reported intense mental activity with rapid thoughts that seemed to connect recursively, making it difficult to focus on any single thought for long. They also experienced a loss of sense of time. Visual descriptions were not provided in detail but mentioned as being challenging to articulate. The experience was accompanied by physical sensations such as lying down and possibly sitting up at some point.

The participant engaged in drawing and writing during the trip, finding it easier to associate freely with ideas. After about two hours, the intensity began to subside gradually, allowing for conversation though still somewhat difficult. They went to sleep around 1 AM but continued to feel residual effects into the next day."
1298,1681,"The individual began experiencing intense vertigo shortly after using an unnamed substance. Visual distortions occurred as they were drawing, eventually making it difficult for them to continue sketching. They heard their own voice repeating ""I'm going to die, I don't want to die"" in a mantra-like fashion, though not speaking aloud. The sound then evolved into a chorus of their voices screaming and gibbering, creating an overwhelming auditory experience.

The participant felt physical symptoms such as goosebumps, dry mouth, and coldness with shaking. They became aware that their friend was watching them but found this slightly uncomfortable. Despite the intense sensations, they managed to control their heartbeat voluntarily, which brought a sense of ecstasy. Opening their eyes revealed extremely bright light, and they experienced an overwhelming awareness of their body's functions.

Lying down caused the room to shift as if coming into focus, and the individual felt exceedingly tired, with achy muscles and a sensation of being ungainly and tall. They expressed a desire to go to the zoo after sleeping for about three hours post-trip. The physical effects were minimal during the experience, with deep breathing being the only noticeable noise.

After waking up, there were no significant aftereffects. The participant felt that the initial panic did not detract from their overall experience and believed it provided a necessary wake-up call regarding their safety and well-being."
1299,1636,"The individual began by smoking marijuana to prepare for the experience in a quiet setting. They then smoked salvia divinorum from a tobacco pipe. Upon inhalation, their living room appeared to transform, becoming brighter and more three-dimensional with distinct spaces between objects. The environment was filled with interlocking geometric patterns in colors such as brown, light pastel green, mustard yellow, and pale blue.

The participant felt an urgency to lie down in a dark room due to the intensity of the experience. When they got up, their motor control was impaired, making it difficult to walk properly. The dominant visual pattern network seemed powerful and commanding.

Additionally, the individual perceived that this altered environment knew them personally, evoking a sense of familiarity and possibly concern about becoming stuck in this state. However, there was no fear associated with this perception. The experience did not include the profound feeling of being in touch with divinity as they had experienced previously on similar occasions."
1300,1597,"The participant smoked an extract of a plant substance, experiencing rapid onset of intense effects. They saw visual hallucinations including thin men with white outfits, bowties, and cookhats, reminiscent of the 1950s. The experience was characterized by fear and confusion about parallel realities and reincarnation. On a second attempt, they spoke Greek and asked ""who am I"" in desperation. Chewing the leaves resulted in negligible effects."
1301,1638,"The participant had their second experience of an unnamed substance at around 1:05 PM after consuming marijuana together with a friend. The effects began in the mouth and throat area for the participant, who experienced euphoria and entered a semi-familiar state of tripping distinct from other substances like acid or shrooms.

While the participant was immersed in vivid visual experiences such as colorful swirls and an expansive reality filled with stars, planets, and beams of energy, their friend reported only brief sensations. The participant became aware of a bluish/purple form that morphed but never took on a definite shape, existing in a fuller 3D appearance.

During the experience, the participant felt dehydrated and experienced physical distortions such as feeling shorter than usual while walking to the bathroom. They also observed fractal leaf patterns moving around on the ceiling when lying down, which changed color over time.

The trip lasted for about an hour with residual effects of a narcotic feeling continuing for another 30-45 minutes after returning to normal open-eye reality."
1302,7420,"The participant began their day intending to use cannabis but instead used Salvia Splendens due to unavailability. They smoked the substance outdoors in a wooded area, feeling effects similar to cannabis but with additional subtle sensations. The initial high was followed by a relaxed tiredness over an hour. Throughout the experience, they remained seated against a tree and interacted with their surroundings, including birds singing and squirrels chattering."
1303,4239,"The participant experienced a consistent sequence of events during each use, including seeing aspects of their personality as if they were rolling by on a printing press. They encountered entities referred to as 'Salvia' people who could see everything about them, which was uncomfortable at times. During one trip, after an argument with their girlfriend, the participant received a message from these entities advising them to be thankful for her and not to become upset unjustifiably. This led to a deeper appreciation of their girlfriend's feelings on the issue they were arguing about."
1304,1558,"The participant smoked an unknown substance through a water pipe, likely a potent extract of Salvia divinorum. They prepared by creating a safe environment and meditating before smoking. However, due to underestimating its potency and making some preparation mistakes, the experience was overwhelming. The user felt isolated from their known reality and experienced fear as they were pulled further away from it. During this time, they communicated with unseen entities, telling them that they were just a little creature who wanted to go home. After about four minutes, the force pulling them away weakened, allowing them to feel back in control. The user then sought comfort from their sitter and noticed subtle open-eye visuals of colored light waves sweeping across the room."
1305,1541,"The participant began by taking 1.8 mL of an extract and later smoked multiple doses of standardized leaves. Initially, they experienced mild effects including increased mental clarity and subtle physical sensations. After several doses, intense experiences occurred: the individual felt as if falling off the edge of the universe and peeling away layers of reality. They remained lucid throughout this process. A wise presence communicated telepathically, encouraging the participant to face their fears and promising a future meeting. The experience was overwhelming, causing difficulty in walking and maintaining balance."
1306,6396,"The participant began by smoking an unspecified substance through a homemade pipe. They felt disoriented and had difficulty moving after inhaling deeply from the pipe. Upon realizing they were high, they communicated incoherently with a friend via AIM before smoking another bowl of the substance. This time, their memory was not as impaired.

While under the influence, the participant experienced vivid visual hallucinations. They saw psilocybe cubenesis mushrooms and followed one into a giant vortex. In this state, they perceived buckets of water and liquid nitrogen tanks in a basement setting. A schoolmate appeared, flipping a switch on a tank that caused her boyfriend to faint in class. The participant then became the football player and started flying, seeing themselves from a third-person perspective with mushrooms growing out of their back.

The experience continued with abstract visualizations such as sperm multiplying into art pieces, moving through caves, and emerging from mountains. They observed magnetic field lines protecting Earth from solar particles before witnessing the planet's destruction. Other visuals included an infinite array of parallel planes in space, a mailbox opening to release bats, mycelium growing on mushrooms, and a tree emerging from a box.

As the effects wore off around 2:45 AM, the participant felt tired but continued to experience some visualizations before going to sleep. They dreamt about smoking more of the substance and wandering incoherently looking for their parked car."
1307,1133,"At 12:00 PM, the individual inhaled smoke and felt strange as if outside themselves. By 12:05 PM, their vision became distorted, appearing two-dimensional with blurriness. They perceived a subtle path or airstrip leading them forward but resisted moving onto it despite hearing an auditory command to do so.

At around 12:15 PM, the individual felt half-awake and euphoric, walking downstairs to look outside without visual distortions but still feeling spaced out. After about two to three minutes, they returned to reality. For the next thirty minutes, they remained in a euphoric state, finding music particularly pleasurable before the effects completely dissipated within an hour."
1308,4931,"The participant took two doses of an unspecified substance, leading to a rapid onset of effects. Initially, they felt their vision being peeled away from left to right, causing disorientation and fear. They attempted to grasp onto what remained of their reality but were unable to communicate effectively during this time. As the experience progressed, the individual perceived parts of their body disappearing one by one before gradually reappearing in reverse order. The entire episode lasted approximately 10 minutes and was described as both terrifying and profound."
1309,959,"The individual began by inhaling an unspecified substance from a pipe containing about 1-1/2 leaves. As they inhaled, they felt a force moving up their chest and then pulling down suddenly. They heard a voice say ""You have had enough,"" which they attributed to the pipe. The room transformed with stairs appearing where there were none before, gears turning everywhere, and their feet sinking through the floor.

Several extraterrestrial beings appeared in the room. Two of them communicated with the individual, saying ""You have now entered reality"" and ""You see as we see."" The music playing, Autechre's 'Amber' album, sounded like everything being seen visually. The individual heard their name, messages, white noise, and distortion within the music.

The participant's mother then appeared at the top of the stairs with a face that had an alligator-like mouth and sickly yellow skin. This frightened the individual, causing them to ""jump out"" of the scene and reappear in their normal room but with things still appearing abnormal. They disposed of the pipe and went to bed, continuing to experience hallucinations and delusions for about an hour and a half.

This trip was more intense than previous experiences with the substance, lasting longer and involving greater physical movement."
1310,991,"The individual began by placing the smoking apparatus near their bed and preparing the extract for inhalation. After inhaling, they noticed a rapid heartbeat and bodily pulsations. They then inhaled again and felt as if they were entering another state of consciousness. The experience involved gliding through what seemed to be a membrane into an unfamiliar landscape covered with leaves.

In this environment, the participant encountered an entity that emerged from the ground, partially obscured by the leaves. This entity appeared to have feminine characteristics and was described as having life-like qualities. After observing this entity for some time, the individual felt themselves moving backwards, causing the entity to dissolve back into the leaf-covered ground."
1311,940,"The participant experienced two sessions involving an unnamed substance. In the first session outdoors, both participants felt disconnected from their bodies and reality, experiencing a strong pull towards the south. The physical sensation was cool and numb. After about half an hour, they returned to a state of pleasant sedation with a greenish tinge to the world.

In the second indoor session, the participant smoked a larger dose and experienced visual distortions, including a hazy room with a slight green tint. They felt their mind being pulled into a void behind them, seeing reality as 2D images in a wall-like structure. In this void, they perceived all people on Earth connected by fibers emanating from the void to their heads.

The participant encountered two entities: one male and one female. The male entity had a powerful but calm presence, while the female was described as dark, spindly, strong, and wise. They communicated that the participant was putting up resistance due to fear of losing identity. After this realization, the participant returned to reality with a sense of personal insight.

The second participant also experienced two entities: one male described as resembling a frog (likely influenced by a frog sticker seen before closing eyes) and another female entity. The male entity gestured for the second participant to follow a railway track further away from them but did not proceed beyond this point.

Both participants noted similarities in their experiences, including encounters with the same entities."
1312,3829,"The individual began by smoking a small amount of an unknown substance and experienced mild, short-lived effects. After reflecting on the initial dose, they smoked a larger bowl and felt intense waves of energy throughout their body, particularly in the jaw area. They observed evenly spaced longitudinal rainbow-colored lines that formed into a large green, organic machine-like structure. This entity seemed to awaken them to new feelings and thoughts.

The individual then attempted to stand but fell to the floor. While on the ground, they perceived the blanket as a strange liquid and experienced euphoria as the effects began to subside. The peak lasted approximately one minute and a half. After coming down from this experience, they smoked another bowl, feeling in control but perceiving reality differently, as if in a movie.

During this second peak, multiple voices and presences were felt around them, leading to confusion about their daily routine and the nature of their life. They interacted with their dogs during this time. The third peak lasted two minutes, followed by an hour of confusion where they had urges to perform mundane tasks repeatedly. Overall, the experience left them feeling cleansed and more connected to the world around them."
1313,3855,"The individual smoked one bong hit of an extract and immediately experienced themselves as part of a white picket fence. They lost all sense of being a living person during this experience, believing they were always just a part of the fence. After opening their eyes out of fear, it took them a minute to realize they were still a human. The experience seemed to symbolize routine and sameness in life."
1314,1500,"The narrator smoked an unidentified plant substance from a bong for the first time in this setting. Immediately after inhalation, they felt intense effects similar to those of a mushroom trip but lasting only briefly. The friend who followed suit experienced difficulty speaking and laughing uncontrollably before attempting to call his brother into the room. Upon entering, the brother also smoked the substance and reported feeling its effects spread from head to fingers and back again. Both friends expressed gratitude for the experience, describing it as unlike anything they had previously encountered."
1315,3419,"The individual began the experience alone, inhaling an extract in two hits while listening to self-composed ambient music. Immediately after inhalation, they felt their consciousness leave the back of their head and experienced confusion about their identity and purpose. They lost track of time and had difficulty distinguishing past, present, and future. The participant reported enhanced sensory perception and a feeling that their astral body wanted to exit their physical form twice.

About eight minutes into the experience, the individual stood up and felt normal again after 30 minutes. They consumed valerian root to alleviate potential insomnia. During the trip, an entity named Marie or Maria was perceived, though details about this interaction were not provided beyond the name of the entity."
1316,695,"The participant smoked a large dose of the substance and immediately experienced a shift in perception, feeling as though they became part of the wall in front of them. They felt an intense conviction that their previous life as a human being was an illusion and that this new state of being part of the wall was the true reality. This realization brought about a profound sense of loss and horror at the thought that their past 30 years had been lived in a dream-like state.

As the effects began to wear off, the participant experienced waves of relief as their perception started to align with their memories of life before the experience. The next day, they felt euphoric and developed an enhanced appreciation for being alive and the reality they previously took for granted."
1317,1338,"The participant inhaled a small bowl of 25 mg 10X enhanced leaf and experienced visual distortions almost immediately. They perceived their friends as part of the room's structure; for example, they saw the doorway as their friends standing near them. When looking straight ahead, they felt like there were millions of stacked people stretching far into the distance. The participant also observed their friends as if they were in a rolodix, with images protruding from them when looked at directly. The trip lasted approximately seven minutes but seemed shorter to the individual."
1318,498,"Gwynne and Bobby smoked a substance through a pipe at Bobby's house when his parents were away. Gwynne experienced vivid visual phenomena shortly after inhaling, including colors that seemed to twist in space like a kaleidoscope. The colors she saw were primarily blue, red, and yellow, composed of tiny rabbits.

Gwynne then perceived an alternate reality on her right side, described as a light bluish-green plane. She felt a presence calling her from this other world but was unsure how to reach it. To her left, she saw Bobby and tried to explain the situation to him. Gwynne heard a mocking voice repeating her words after a few seconds, originating from deep within the perceived alternate reality.

Bobby's experience involved understanding his alter-ego and realizing that he might have multiple selves. He saw two other beings in an alternate reality who resembled people he knew but were not exactly those individuals. They attempted to move an object together, which transformed into a large spike that was annoyingly stabbing him in the face. Bobby tried to explain this experience to Gwynne before it folded in on itself and disappeared.

After the effects began to wear off, both participants felt hot and sweaty with pressure on their bodies. The entire experience lasted less than 15 minutes for both of them, with residual effects lasting no more than 30 minutes."
1319,497,"The participant began by smoking a small amount of an extract substance in a pipe outdoors to avoid potential hazards. They experienced mild visual disturbances where bushes appeared unusual and sound pulsations. After about five minutes, the effects started waning but they still perceived some auditory changes similar to previous experiences with another substance.

Next, the participant used nitrous oxide, experiencing tingling sensations in their teeth, hands, and toes within 15 seconds. Closed-eye visuals returned, featuring black and purple patterns that varied wildly across their field of vision. The effects lasted about five minutes before subsiding completely after approximately 20 minutes from the initial smoking."
1320,448,"The individual began their experience in a dark room, listening to music. They reported feeling the effects of an inhaled substance almost immediately after taking a large dose. Their vision became distorted with blue edges around the periphery. The participant then experienced a sensation of floating and rotating on an imaginary axis, maintaining their upright position despite this unusual orientation.

In front of them appeared many people arranged to form the word ""LOVE."" A male voice in a deep tone emphasized the importance of love during the experience. Additionally, a female presence was noted, occasionally speaking throughout the event. The participant attempted to interact with one of these entities by reaching out and felt something solid under their hands.

After some time, the individual's senses returned partially, and they found themselves sitting up in a different part of the room, still holding lighters tightly. They were startled by the return of normal sounds and sensations, realizing that the experience had ended."
1321,436,"The narrator and a friend, J, decided to try an unknown substance in a wooded area at night. After taking the first dose, J exhibited disorientation and spoke incoherently. The narrator then experienced visual hallucinations of a vanilla ice cream cone with a cherry on top and felt overwhelmed, falling into the snow. Upon regaining their footing, they noticed blue glowing trees around them.

After about ten minutes, both participants took another hit. This time, the narrator saw similar blue glowing trees and felt invigorated, going for a walk while J remained seated. During this period, J spoke in contradictory phrases such as ""I need to go run now"" followed by ""I feel sick,"" then laughed and fell backward into the snow.

After both hits, they left the woods feeling mentally energized but physically relaxed. They engaged in deep philosophical discussions about abstract concepts of identity and existence, which lasted for the remainder of the evening."
1322,2166,"A user smoked approximately three large leaves of a plant in a water pipe with another person, taking turns inhaling several times each. The experience lasted about one to two hours, divided into different stages. No specific entities were encountered during this trip."
1323,2162,"The participant began by consuming an unspecified substance, feeling initially only slightly unusual. While in their friend's bedroom with their girlfriend present, they experienced a sudden onset of intense effects after about 5 minutes. They perceived their friends as part of their own body and felt that reality had revealed a hidden truth to them. The environment appeared flat and blue, and time perception was distorted.

After approximately 10 minutes, the participant returned to normal consciousness but found it difficult to explain their experience due to its intensity. They attempted another dose about ten minutes later, which again led to intense hallucinations and altered perceptions of reality lasting around 10 minutes. However, they do not remember this second trip clearly.

Two further attempts several hours later produced only mild effects. The participant felt unnerved but intrigued by the experience and noted a pleasant after-effect for the rest of the day."
1324,2160,"The participant began with two doses which produced mild altered perceptions and lasted around 15 minutes. They then took three additional doses leading to a more intense experience. Initially, there was a sensation of the body splitting into multiple parts, followed by visual distortions where they perceived the ceiling from numerous viewpoints simultaneously. Time perception became distorted, and there was an awareness of floating outside their physical form while still connected through a thin bungee cord-like feeling. The participant experienced fear but remembered it as temporary. As the experience progressed, there were moments of heightened awareness of breathing and body sensations. Eventually, they returned to normal reality with clear perceptions and a period of introspection about reality."
1325,2159,"In the first experience, the participant smoked a single leaf and felt an immediate sense of being pulled from their head into space about six feet away. Upon opening their eyes, they perceived everything as more vibrant and energetic but quickly returned to normal after another inhalation. This second attempt resulted in a heavy pressure on the head and disorientation.

The second experience involved smoking three leaves with roommates present. The participant experienced intense physical effects such as drooling and sweating, along with a sense of being pulled from their body and unclear about their surroundings. They felt like they were someone else, sometimes an Indian in a ritual or a kid in a B-movie. This state lasted for approximately twenty minutes.

In the third experience, smoking three leaves led to confusion about time and place, feeling simultaneously present in multiple locations and times. The participant perceived reality as having an 'edged' quality and felt like they were existing in numerous places at once. As the effects wore off, they experienced joy and laughter.

The fourth experience involved a different leaf and produced only mild physical effects with minimal mental impact. The participant was aware of others around them but could not fully enter the trance state."
1326,2158,"In a dark room, the participant consumed an extract of leaves through a bong. They held their breath for an extended period before exhaling. As the effects set in, they noticed the room began to spin side-to-side. Lying down, they experienced confusion about being human and heard voices asking questions, though they couldn't understand what was being asked. The participant felt as if everything in their mind had become a separate entity.

After some time, they saw a shadowy figure of their friend moving erratically, with the voice distorted. They heard ""stand up, you'll feel better"" and complied, gradually regaining a sense of self and human reality. Vision stabilized quickly, and the trip concluded after approximately 15-20 minutes."
1327,2148,"The individual reported feeling their body dissolve and experiencing distorted sensations. They noted an unpleasant itching and scratching sensation throughout the experience which prevented them from fully letting go. At one point, they became aware of a tickling sensation in what was perceived as their hand. This awareness led to a realization about their concentrated focus on that spot. The individual then experienced a feedback loop in their brain characterized by repetitive ""ping"" sounds."
1328,2146,"The individual began by smoking an unknown substance, feeling unsure about the dosage or method of consumption. They experienced physical sensations such as feeling naked and instinctively covering themselves. A presence was felt, described as having bumps and spikes that remained constant with patience. The participant perceived a voice and communicated with what they believed to be a sentient plant. This entity was physically present and communicated in a non-human manner. The individual reported being divided into two states: one believing the experience and feeling it physically, while the other maintained their normal reality. They struggled between these two states, eventually returning to their usual mental state but still felt connected to the plant."
1329,2145,"The author's friends had experiences while using a substance, including one who visited a childhood memory of writing to his mother in Massachusetts, another who felt packed in a crate full of elves, and the third who walked through a dark tunnel into an exotic garden. The author tried various methods of consuming the substance, such as smoking up to seven bowls and eating 10 leaves in a quid, but only experienced mild effects. When combined with acid and grass or ecstasy, the effects were heightened but not as dramatic as expected.

The author's best experience was from sharing a bong hit with a roommate, where they felt cold and clammy legs, slight nausea, and an inability to communicate. They perceived everything in slow, gradual waves while feeling relaxed and breaking out in sweat. After a few minutes, the effects subsided enough for them to walk and talk normally.

The author found that leaves provided milder experiences compared to smoking or other methods."
1330,2143,"The participant inhaled smoke and within 15 seconds experienced two large cone-shaped tunnels appearing from the corner of the room. These tunnels were filled with colorful points of light and seemed alive, growing and rotating. The participant felt a swirling sensation both visually and physically, which was powerful but not unpleasant. They believed these tunnels represented the meaning of everything that has ever existed and that they had to be part of them.

After about two minutes, ordinary reality returned, and the participant felt silly for believing in the tunnels' existence. Ten minutes later, the participant took a smaller dose and experienced multi-colored paper chains spreading everywhere when their eyes were closed. These chains represented probabilities of any event happening at any time, existing simultaneously throughout past, present, and future.

The experience concluded with a peaceful afterglow lasting about ten minutes during which the participant repeatedly expressed amazement at the substance's effects."
1331,2141,"The individual reports using the substance twice. During both sessions, they felt an external pressure against their body from a discernible direction. They also experienced visually-interpreted perceptions in what seemed like other dimensions. In one instance, there was a vision of rushing past windows in a structure similar to a greenhouse, accompanied by a strong sense of being near something forgotten yet familiar and powerful.

The participant noted synesthesia with music, experiencing visual sensations that moved in time with the beat. They felt grass growing from their hands and observed vegetable visions where leaves and stems appeared and built upon each other as the music developed. Tactile sensations changed to an orange-green feeling tone, and there was a slight disorientation along with loss of balance and coordination.

After the experience, while lying down to sleep, they saw brilliant flashes of light and felt a sense of rushing behind their eyelids. Hours later, there was a perception of a shimmering barrier or screen between themselves and an imaginal realm that had been briefly visited during the session."
1332,2140,"A. had a powerful experience after inhaling an extract of dried leaves through a pipe. Initially, he felt overwhelmed and disoriented, lying quietly on the floor for several minutes. He expressed fear and confusion, feeling that the experience was a joke that everyone else understood except him. A. perceived himself as becoming one with the cosmos, losing differentiation between self and other. During these moments, he saw the room briefly before being ""rolled under"" again into an altered state.

In one instance, when sitting up, A. felt his hands resting on an ocean of tightly packed fish instead of a carpet. Another time, he perceived the floor as chest-high, with only his upper torso and head emerging momentarily before dissolving back into the ground. He was concerned that his wife would be taken under with him during these intense experiences.

A.'s friend Star also tried the extract later in the evening and found it to be very powerful, though she enjoyed the experience more than A., laughing throughout her trip."
1333,1907,"The participant reported two drug-induced experiences. In the first experience, after consuming DXM and smoking an unknown substance, visual hallucinations occurred including a red neon wireframe cat and a large plant with elliptical leaves. The second experience involved a sensation of body compression and rotation followed by an out-of-body-like state where the individual felt they were living a different life as 'person B' without their usual identity ('person A'). This lasted for about 5-10 seconds before returning to normal consciousness."
1334,13,"The participant took a large dose of an extract and began experiencing colorful fractal-like patterns which they interpreted as their own thoughts. As their thoughts changed, so did the patterns on a minute level. They had a deep but incomprehensible revelation about thoughts, the substance, colors, and a bus-stop metaphor. This led to a realization that they were insane. The participant felt reassured by being in a familiar setting with friends nearby."
1335,36244,"The participant consumed a potent substance and experienced a rapid onset of effects after two inhalations. They felt a cool pressure sensation and dropped the smoking device. Closing their eyes, they perceived faces in the room swirling together and lost a sense of self-existence. Believing they were dead or no longer human, they became unresponsive to others. A friend held them down as they freaked out, while another person almost attacked them for dropping the bong. After 15 minutes, the participant slowly returned to reality and reflected on the experience."
1336,12436,"The participant consumed the substance at 4:00 pm in a park setting using an aluminum foil pipe. After inhaling strongly and holding it for 20 seconds, they felt very stoned. They experienced a warm, fuzzy feeling where they loved the world and felt distant from recent negative interactions. The participant engaged in basketball and noticed an attractive woman reading a book whom they desired to approach but did not.

In the evening, after the effects had worn off somewhat, the participant returned to the park near a lake and smoked more of the substance. They experienced similar feelings of being high without the speed sensation associated with ecstasy. At one point, standing up made them feel dizzy without nausea. The participant continued smoking multiple bowls in an attempt to achieve visual effects but did not succeed."
1337,12448,"The participant experienced a powerful effect after consuming an unknown substance multiple times. Initially, they perceived the room dividing into sectors that seemed to move toward them, leading to disorientation. As a result, the individual walked around the room but later found it in a state of chaos with clothes scattered and furniture displaced."
1338,88978,"The participant was sitting alone in a friend's apartment when they took an unknown substance. After inhaling it, they felt frozen and saw a well-dressed dark-haired woman showing an 'image' to a young couple. The couple quickly decided they were satisfied with the image, and the woman started rolling up the image, causing panic in the participant who tried to escape.

The participant found themselves down the hall, still wearing their jacket but trapped by it as one hand was stuck inside. They walked spiraling down the hallway until they heard voices from a stairwell. It took them a few seconds to realize where they were and that they had taken a substance, leading to a psychedelic experience."
1339,19646,"The participant began their journey by preparing with meditation and a short prayer before consuming an extract substance through a water pipe. They experienced abstract thinking and felt as though their thoughts were being observed. In what they describe as ""Salvia Space,"" 3D shapes flew around them, and they could see through their eyelids.

During the experience, there was a sensation of pressure and a feeling similar to dying, which the participant interpreted as an attempt by an entity (referred to as Sally) to take them with her. The participant hesitated due to fear of getting stuck in this space but eventually agreed to go along. However, they were unable to fully leave their body because of lingering doubts and fear.

The dialogue during the experience was clear and lasted longer than previous journeys. Upon returning to reality, the participant felt a sense of accomplishment and creativity. The entire journey seemed to last only seconds despite feeling prolonged, and the effects wore off within half an hour."
1340,49046,"Two friends consumed an unspecified substance, leading to a strong psychedelic experience for one of them while the other experienced a brief headache. The tripper found themselves in an endless landscape of gas stations on either side of a highway. They walked into one of these gas stations and encountered a man with a pompadour hairstyle wearing a 1950s-style petrol attendant's uniform, who waved at them amicably. The tripper then exited the station and continued walking along the highway, laughing heartily due to the absurdity of the endless gas stations. After some time, the experience ended, and they returned to their friend's room with a smile on their flushed face."
1341,115742,"The participant smoked an unspecified amount of a substance and experienced intense changes in perception. Initially, they witnessed what appeared to be a normal scene but felt a sudden shift into a higher dimension where reality folded into itself. They saw an ice cream sandwich merge with reality, causing them to realize their own nonexistence. This triggered a loop of contradictions and the sensation of being dragged into nonexistence.

The participant perceived reality as a gap in a higher dimensional existence, referred to as ""zipper reality."" They felt that everything existed only as a complementary empty space of another reality and was merely a leftover from a higher plane destined for nonexistence. An entity from this zipper reality communicated with the participant, urging them to close the contradiction they caused.

The experience left the participant feeling terrified yet reflective about the insignificance of existence and the need to appreciate life more profoundly."
1342,47406,"The individual smoked a substance and experienced immediate visual effects, seeing bright orange before becoming attached to the blade of a windmill. They perceived a cube representing reality that the windmill blade could not penetrate, causing distress and frustration. The person reached out for help from an entity (likely their friend) but became angry at them momentarily. They then led this entity to the windmill blade, attempting to push through the cube of reality again. During this process, they were screaming and in a state of panic. After passing through the cube, they returned to reality briefly before the effects resumed, leading to more distress and screaming. The experience ended with the individual waking up under a glass table in their room, where they consumed water to help them come down from the effects."
1343,50665,"The individual began the experience in their room after inhaling a substance from a bowl. Immediately, they felt intense physical sensations that dominated their perception, making them feel as though everything was connected through an external energy wave. This sensation was accompanied by auditory cues resembling tape being pulled off something flat and a feeling of scraping against surfaces.

The participant lost control over their body movements, experiencing a sense of floating towards the door while trying to remain still. They felt panic due to confusion about whether they were in an out-of-body experience or if they were still in their room. As they moved downstairs, objects appeared distorted; for example, they perceived themselves as fitting into spaces between staircase bars like a gear.

The trip lasted approximately 10 minutes before the individual regained some sense of reality but remained confused and irrational. They noted that having someone present to assist them would have improved the experience."
1344,29169,"The participant experienced intense visuals while under the influence of an unknown substance. Initially, the room turned red, and the metal rocker head shop owner appeared to be satin. The floor then broke apart, revealing a gigantic red well of fire into which the participant fell. During this time, they felt disconnected from their own existence.

After about 2 minutes, the visuals subsided, but the participant remained disoriented and unable to feel their body in a normal way. They described feeling as if their body and mind were separate entities. The participant also experienced an altered sense of self, where they felt like they could create and destroy others within their perception.

The trip lasted for about 20 minutes, with the peak intensity lasting around 5 minutes. The user advised not panicking during the experience and emphasized that it only lasts a short time."
1345,105661,"The narrator visited their friend's house where they were introduced to an unnamed substance by the friend's older brother. Upon entering the room, the narrator noticed a strong unpleasant odor and awkward silence before the brother began laughing. The brother offered the narrator a chance to try it, which they accepted despite initial hesitation.

After inhaling the smoke from a joint, the narrator experienced an accelerated heartbeat and a feeling of isolation, as if the room was the only thing left in the universe traveling at ultra speed but unable to find anything else. They felt detached from their friend and reality, becoming frightened by the gradual loss of grip on reality. Time seemed to stop, creating a sense of eternal suffering.

The narrator's ability to speak returned when their friend called them, and as they looked at their friend, everything started to slow down reassuringly. They managed to mumble a few words before regaining full control over speech. The room eventually slowed down completely, and the friend asked if the narrator wanted to eat something. The narrator nodded instinctively.

They went to the kitchen where they ate leftover pizza, experiencing an unusual feeling of bliss and rebirth. This experience left them unsure about their feelings towards the substance but certain that it is not a fun drug and should be taken seriously as it can overwhelm one's attempts at control."
1346,13135,"The author conducted extensive research on a psychoactive substance before deciding to purchase it for personal use. They smoked three bowls of crushed dried leaves over 15 minutes in their dorm room. Upon smoking, the author experienced a pressure sensation in their head and felt confused about motor skills and body load. Time seemed to move faster, creating a sense of disconnection.

The experience was described as dreamy and far-off, with minor visual distortions such as swirling holes in ceiling tiles. The author briefly interacted with a neighbor, feeling happy and sociable despite the altered state. After 4-6 minutes, the peak effects began to subside, lasting no more than 30 minutes total.

The author smoked the substance several more times alone and in combination with cannabis. They concluded that while there were visual effects, they did not achieve a ""full blown"" experience as described in their research and decided to purchase an extract for future use."
1347,93159,"The participant entered a state characterized by dizziness and disorientation within seconds of ingestion. They immediately lay down in child's pose due to the intensity. Visual distortions were noted, resembling being inside a prism, accompanied by feelings of spinning and losing spatial awareness. The experience was described as intense with fear and strange body vibrations. After about a minute, the participant regained some sense of self but felt sweaty and had a headache. They went to their room, removed clothing due to sweating, closed blinds, and experienced mild discomfort before falling asleep."
1348,112897,"The participant describes four experiences with a substance, focusing on the last one as the most vivid. During this fourth trip, after inhaling the substance, the participant felt a strong physical sensation described as body buzzing and a heavy wave-like pressure. As they closed their eyes, darkness was abruptly ""ripped open"" from the right side of their face, revealing what appeared to be a new reality. This new reality involved the ground and dirt outside an aunt's house being flipped over in an accordion-like motion from right to left.

In this altered state, the participant perceived younger versions of family members who were currently in their life, as well as the aunt's house appearing as it did years ago when their mother was alive. The family members appeared larger than life and seemed surprised by the participant's presence. They attempted to hide the place from the participant and tried to flip the reality back around to re-zip the participant into the original reality.

The participant felt stuck during this process, with their elbow and knee getting caught in the zipper-like motion. They communicated out loud, asking for help to move these body parts so they could be fully zipped back into the original reality. After being re-zipped, the participant opened their eyes and returned to normal after a few minutes of prickly skin sensations."
1349,12093,"The participant experienced several sessions with an unnamed substance. During the first attempt, they felt a strong force pulling them backward and then becoming detached from reality, as if sitting in a cardboard box looking out through small eye holes. They also noted internal pressure on their head that varied based on head movements. In subsequent sessions, the effects were more intense, leading to a loss of awareness of breathing and an inability to distinguish between themselves and their surroundings. The participant felt a sense of not being born yet or having already died, along with a semi-pleasant drowning sensation. They also experienced disillusionment about life, feeling that it was a joke and comparing the experience to realizing the wizard in ""The Wizard of Oz"" was just an ordinary man."
1350,12082,"The participant smoked Salvia for the first time at John Brewer's beach in St Thomas. After smoking sub-standard marijuana, they packed a bowl with Salvia and took turns inhaling it. The participant felt very tall and distant from objects below them. Homeless dogs on the beach appeared emaciated and ghost-like, making the participant feel unable to touch them. Walking towards the beach seemed extremely long despite being only 50 feet away. Shadows and negative spaces became more prominent than visible objects. The mind was filled with pleasant thoughts.

The ocean, sky, and surroundings were vividly perceived: the ocean in front, space above, and a frozen image of the road, tree, and car behind. People appeared flat and frozen in time. Reality seemed simplified into three planes: foreground, middle space, and background. The 5-20 minute walk to the beach felt like at least 5 hours due to slowed perception of time.

Returning to the car, the participant drove home with a pleasant comedown. Friends reported minimal effects compared to the narrator's intense experience."
1351,11758,"The participant took two hits from a bowl containing an unspecified substance. After the second hit, they began laughing uncontrollably. They then saw various objects floating above them and chose a yellow diamond, which transformed into a tunnel leading to a spaceship. Inside the spaceship, they observed mechanical horses pushing discolored boxes along a corridor. As their experience concluded, they felt themselves descending back towards reality while being guided by the yellow diamonds. The participant reported feeling numbness in their legs for about five minutes before returning to normal."
1352,11688,"The individual began their experience by smoking from a pipe filled with the substance. They felt a pulling sensation along the back of their body but not affecting their face or chest. As they continued to smoke, the room started spinning slowly towards the opposite wall. The participant noticed that their thoughts influenced the environment; each thought caused the room to spin into different scenarios, though rapidly changing thoughts prevented any single scene from manifesting fully.

The individual observed colored lights in the room and associated them with various concepts. One light color reminded them of a beach, briefly transporting them to a road flanked by palm trees. However, as the colors changed, this scene faded away. The spinning motion then took the form of a palm tree shape within which they could still see the crumbled-up room.

The participant's friend offered more but it did not alter their experience significantly. They were given a pillow and closed their eyes, feeling as if they held life in their hands and controlled different realities within those scenes. Upon regaining normalcy, they felt awake and refreshed despite physical sensations of strangeness."
1353,10137,"The participant began by consuming DXM, experiencing mild disassociation. They then smoked Salvia divinorum, which intensified the experience. An entity described as the ""Salvia spirit"" communicated with the participant, inviting them on a journey despite their DXM use. The second hit of Salvia pushed the participant into an intense state characterized by vivid visuals and profound mental changes. They were transported via a train made of bright plastic alphabet letters to what they perceived as infancy. During this period, the participant experienced uncontrollable laughter, drooling, and moments of ego loss followed by the rebuilding of language centers."
1354,27562,"The participant began the experience after consuming an unknown substance in a calm setting with close friends. Initially, they felt as though everything was glowing slightly and objects appeared to be throbbing mildly. They then concluded that they had experienced a stroke and were dead. This realization led them to drink another beer while contemplating their existence.

Two friends later joined the participant, whom they could recognize by initials but not names. The participant greeted them happily, asking if they too were ""dead."" Their friends assured them they were alive. Two more people then joined, and all of them confirmed that the participant was not dead. The effects wore off after about 15 minutes.

The experience lasted approximately 15 minutes from start to finish."
1355,62617,"The participant and their friend gathered around a campfire without distractions. After some marijuana use, the participant took two bong rips of salvia. They immediately dropped the bong due to its effects. The participant's surroundings dissolved, and they saw only mountains and the fire. A female voice spoke about government control versus human tranquility, suggesting that nothing was wrong with society.

The fire appeared closer, merging with the sky and mountains. The chair the participant was sitting on levitated off the ground. The female voice told them they could time travel but must return to reality as they had been away for too long. After this experience, which lasted about 20 minutes according to their friend, the participant felt as if they had returned from another world after months."
1356,39663,"The participant experienced an altered state where they felt transformed into a creature with rectangular limbs. They found themselves on a level with a white sky and encountered multiple rectangular platforms that seemed inherently attractive, leading them to climb from one to another without interaction. Initially content, the participant later became panicked upon realizing there was no end to this climbing existence. Other entities were present, also engaged in climbing but not interacting with each other or the participant. The experience lasted only a short time but felt prolonged and left a lasting impression."
1357,114827,"The participant experienced intense visual hallucinations during which they perceived themselves disintegrating into individual cells. They observed a massive cube with an ecosystem inside before moving through a rotating cylinder towards a plane of tiles. Each tile was identified as a portal, one showing the friend's apartment and another depicting a humanoid figure being pulled into black goop. The participant felt overwhelmed and dove back into their original tile, returning to their body where they curled up in fetal position for several minutes."
1358,51114,"The participant had a strong experience after inhaling a small amount of a hallucinogenic substance using a water pipe. The effects came on quickly within 10-15 seconds, causing intense time distortions and visual alterations where the room appeared to divide into tiny horizontal segments. There was a sensation of losing self-awareness and an ego dissolution. The participant felt a falling sensation and had difficulty maintaining physical awareness. They attempted to hold onto a table but were assisted by their sitter who spoke in calming tones, helping them regain some control. After about 2.5 minutes, the intensity began to wane, and they moved from sitting to lying down on a bed. The experience was described as highly intense and recommended starting with smaller doses for those unfamiliar with rapid-onset psychoactives."
1359,50943,"The participant experiences a sense of pressure in their chest after inhaling the substance. They question their identity and briefly believe that they are a soul with multiple bodies to inhabit, but this thought is fleeting. The participant then perceives their house as a collapsible tent that begins to deflate on one side. As the deflation progresses towards their location, they feel the need for a body and see an infinite number of nearly invisible bodies stacked within each other. Realizing they were under the influence of the substance, the participant expresses gratitude for having a body and desires a drink."
1360,52387,"The participant began their experience by smoking an unknown substance in a bong while listening to soft music. After inhaling deeply, they experienced immediate physical effects including dizziness and difficulty balancing. The room appeared to warp slightly at first. They continued to smoke, leading to more pronounced effects over about 10 minutes.

During the peak of the experience, the participant felt as though their movements were controlled by the music playing in the background. Initially unable to break free from this sensation, they eventually managed to lie down and relax. The music seemed to adjust its tempo according to their heartbeat or personal rhythm. As the effects began to subside, the participant noticed that the volume of the music increased as they moved around.

The experience was characterized by a strong feeling of being controlled by external factors (the music) and an internal struggle for control over one's own body. There were no significant visual hallucinations except for a brief warping of the room at the beginning and a light seen after the peak effects had passed. The participant did not interact with any other entities during this experience."
1361,106511,"The participant had their fourth and most intense experience at an undisclosed location atop an elementary school. After inhaling the substance, they felt a strong sensation of being pulled back into the ground, followed by laughter. The visuals began with the sky transforming into colorful clouds. The participant experienced a sense of separation from their friends, as if observing them through a picture frame while feeling pushed away from their world. There were tingling sensations in the body and chain smoking cigarettes extended the effects for a few minutes longer. Post-trip, the individual felt refreshed and questioned reality."
1362,92514,"The participant began their experience after smoking what they believed to be a potent substance, following another person's consumption. They took several hits and quickly entered a profound altered state of consciousness. In this state, they imagined themselves moving through an infinite row of numbers, eventually losing all sense of self and entering a new universe where countless versions of themselves stood in rows conversing with each other.

The participant felt fear that their previous life was a hallucination and had entered reality. They experienced the sensation of chasing their personality down an endless hallway labeled ""everything."" After some time, they returned to their physical body, only to find others asking them questions which angered them. Gradually, they regained their sense of self and came down slowly from the experience.

The participant reflected on the trip, concluding that there are deeper sensory experiences beyond what is normally perceived, and that personality and mental abilities are mechanisms created by the brain to interact with these stimuli. They felt glad about the experience but unsure if they would want to repeat it as their last trip."
1363,111457,"The participant began by inhaling salvia and immediately experienced auditory distortions, perceiving sounds from X-Files as voices coming from behind walls and floors. They felt their mind and soul falling through layers, observing the room from a perspective behind the wall. The experience included time dilation; what seemed like 45 minutes was actually only 45 seconds of a static scene on TV.

The participant then engaged in abstract art, drawing connected lines with ease and filling blank spaces with felt markers. They completed a drawing that resembled an embryo with an umbilical third eye, which they interpreted as unlocking all the answers they needed. The high lasted approximately 10 minutes before fading quickly, after which the participant spent 20 minutes meditating."
1364,111484,"The participant began their experience while standing in their kitchen after inhaling two large hits of an unspecified substance. They immediately felt warm and removed their jacket, which they later put away before retrieving it from the dining room. During this time, they experienced thoughts of being at an amusement park with five humanoid entities, including a worker helping people board a rollercoaster. These entities were described as accepting everything that came their way.

As the experience progressed, the participant felt as if they were aboard an alien spaceship, where the aliens resembled jackets similar to theirs. The creatures appeared angry about something and were preparing for war against Earth, with what seemed like a king and queen leading them. This visualization caused some anxiety regarding the well-being of the participant's family.

The experience lasted approximately 6-7 minutes, during which time the participant returned to their room and lay down on their bed to process the events. They felt completely normal again within seconds after the peak of the experience. Overall, the trip was positive, leaving the participant feeling calmer and more relaxed."
1365,111485,"The participant was in their living room with a friend watching TV when they began experiencing warm and tingly sensations after smoking from a pipe. They removed their jacket due to feeling warm. Attempting to focus on the show became confusing, leading them to ask their friend a question that didn't make sense.

Suddenly, the participant felt as if they were on a floating train in a pinkish-purple landscape with dark humanoid passengers. A worker entity offered tea, which the participant accepted and drank. After drinking the tea, they returned to their living room but felt as though people would soon emerge from the hallway.

The participant then smoked another half bowl of the substance without experiencing warmth. They noticed an entity resembling previous ones filling the gap between their friend and the TV screen. It was difficult for them to communicate logically with their friend during this time, but they quickly returned to normal after a few seconds.

Throughout the experience, entities were present but seemed indifferent towards the participant, giving the impression of being observed by friendly beings."
1366,72911,"The participant experiences reality as an endless stream of replacement patterns, each about 2x4 inches in surface area, moving in liquid-like ribbons that form letter-like shapes. The music appears to influence these patterns. An intelligent female presence is perceived and attempts to teach the participant, initially with urgency but then becomes supportive and encouraging. This entity seems eager to convey a lesson before the experience ends. The participant feels as though they are watching an educational children's program and is given over to astonishment by this vivid and cartoony scene.

The participant also experiences being pulled down to their left side while the female presence remains outside their peripheral vision on the right. They describe seeing a ""rubber pop-up book village"" created from materials in the room, which continues even when they attempt to close their eyes. The entity becomes quiet and calm once mundane logic returns, indicating that the lesson is over.

The experience includes sounds described as low clucks of the tongue, similar to an African click language but with a midrange rumble quality. These sounds make the participant feel self-conscious, though they can dismiss this feeling."
1367,55042,"The participant describes taking a high concentration extract multiple times in one day. During each session, they experience intense physical sensations including a feeling of being pinned to their spot and tunnel vision focused on an air conditioning unit. The individual reports feeling ""fake"" and experiencing time travel-like phenomena during sober periods afterward.

When others take the substance, some individuals laugh or giggle initially but may later become unresponsive or knock over objects in attempts to regain balance. The author advises against walking around during the experience and recommends having a sober person present."
1368,113872,"The participant felt cold after taking a large dose of the substance. They then experienced dissociation, sliding out of their body into another dimension where they were spinning on a bicycle wheel ridden by a paperboy throwing newspapers at houses. An ice cream truck was nearby, and the sun was smiling. The world appeared colorful and cartoonish. After flying into the sky to interact with plants, the participant returned to reality feeling cold, numb, and nauseous. During this time, they were speaking incoherently but with genuine facial expressions, tried to run out of the trailer with unusual strength, and stared at a wall before regaining their senses."
1369,82655,"The participant experienced swirling neon lights and colors that seemed to interact with them, such as forcing them to exhale smoke when they forgot to do so. They then flew alongside many butterflies through colorful trees and grass, encountering chalk rabbits and people-like beings who felt safe. The experience included being on fire but eating the flames which tasted like chocolate, and seeing pink and green candy swirling around them.

The participant took another dose and laid back with their pacifier in their mouth while hugging a stuffed wolf named Floppy. They sank into Floppy's fur and encountered him in his human form, described as gentle and strong. He hugged the participant, kissed their head, and told them they were brave for coming there.

The surroundings dissolved into swirling chocolate and icing before fading away, leaving the participant feeling profoundly loved after waking up from the experience."
1370,19579,"The participant smoked a psychoactive substance and immediately felt its effects, laying down to further engage with the experience. They reported feeling pinned to the ground by an unexplained force that made it difficult to move their hand. As they became more immersed in the experience, they felt detached from reality but still connected through music playing in the background. The user saw a dark matter cliff with horizontal grooves that disappeared upon closer inspection. They communicated with their sitter but were unsure if the sitter understood due to the distance between them. Upon repeating what was said, the user realized they had returned to reality, though they continued to feel detached for two hours."
1371,109528,"The participant experienced a drug-induced trip that consisted of three intertwined levels of perception. In the first level, reality seemed to split and time looped, with actions being performed in parallel universes before execution in the current reality. This created an intense and confusing experience where the individual felt trapped in repetitive actions.

In the second level, the participant's identity shifted to that of their father living in a Soviet apartment 30 years ago. They walked through the hallway turning lights off and on, feeling as though they were their father rather than themselves. The surroundings and people around them became unfamiliar, with difficulty recognizing friends as current acquaintances.

The third level involved synesthesia, where physical sensations translated into tastes of fruits. For instance, the sensation in the arms was experienced as the taste of watermelon, while the pants felt like a mix of melon and carrot. Each action was accompanied by different fruit flavors, creating an unusual sensory experience."
1372,85955,"The participant smoked dried leaves in a bong, experiencing a head rush followed by spinning sensations. They felt heavy and sensitive to light and sound, finding it more enjoyable lying down in dim lighting with mellow music playing. The intense effects lasted 15-25 minutes, leaving the participant introspective for several hours.

On one occasion, while alone at home, the participant experienced a vortex opening behind them, feeling as though Morphine was playing in their living room and other beings were present. These beings communicated telepathically, seemingly amused by the participant's disorientation but glad to have company. The participant felt an urge to be pulled backward into the vortex, walking slowly with eyes closed until they curled up behind a futon couch for about 20 minutes.

After this experience, the participant felt introspective and groggy for a couple of hours before returning to normal."
1373,99190,"The participant inhaled smoke from a freshly cleaned water pipe and felt the effects set in almost immediately after exhaling. They laid down on their bed and noticed a sensation as if something were turning around each arm and tongue. Upon closing their eyes, they saw gears affixed to these body parts and observed monks rotating them. This movement was gradually leading towards a waterfall, which represented an overwhelming experience for the participant.

The participant spoke aloud, which slowed the rotation of the gear on their tongue, causing the monks to stop turning those around their arms as well. They continued speaking with their sitter to stay grounded until the effects diminished. Afterward, they described the trip to their sitter and noted that light seemed more vivid and colors brighter for about an hour."
1374,86607,"The participant experienced a series of rapid transitions through different environments and memories. Initially, they felt emotions from their childhood and saw blurry images of friends and enemies speaking unintelligibly but understood them. The setting then changed to the backyard of their childhood home where they interacted with their brother on a swing before moving to a church environment where they were expected to sing along with others.

The participant then found themselves in a computer room, viewing pictures of nude women while feeling curiosity and guilt. This was followed by an experience in a 6th-grade band class where the teacher yelled at them for not playing their part, evoking feelings of humiliation and rebellion. The setting changed again to pitch blackness with no exit, causing fear and panic.

The participant then found themselves in a canyon at night surrounded by glowing faces representing every person who has ever evoked an emotion in them. They felt overwhelmed by a rush of emotions including jealousy, thankfulness, love, hate, joy, pleasure, sympathy, sadness, anger, and frustration. The narrator covered their ears and screamed to drown out the yelling from the faces.

Finally, they saw a door and ran towards it despite attempts by the glowing faces to block it. Upon opening the door, the experience ended."
1375,73837,"A couple tried an unspecified substance to alleviate pain and achieve dissociative hallucinations. One partner experienced severe leg and calf pain that was not effectively treated by doctors. After smoking a regular dose of the substance, both partners felt a light, calming effect. The affected partner noticed a significant reduction in leg pain and remained comfortable for over 12 hours. The other partner also felt calm but did not hallucinate. Both experienced some headache relief initially, though it was temporary. One partner reported mild nausea that subsided quickly, while the other had improved stomach comfort."
1376,99716,"The participant consumed a high dosage of an unnamed substance and reported feeling as if their soul was being pulled out of their body into a collective flow of consciousness. This flow included all living beings without ego or memory, just their core essence. The participant interacted with powerful entities who were maintaining this flow, supplying everything to different realities.

Near the end of the trip, while still in the flow, the participant saw their friend and tried to pull them into the flow as well, believing it was important for order. As reality began to reassert itself, the participant experienced a recursive visual effect where they saw themselves opening a curtain within themselves repeatedly.

The experience left the participant questioning the nature of time, space, and parallel universes, and feeling uncertain about their own reality."
1377,48820,"The participant took a dose of an unknown substance in their parked car at night. After inhaling the smoke, they became immobile and experienced blackness. A small entity resembling a cartoon strawberry man appeared and invited them to join his friends for fun. The participant initially declined but eventually joined the little strawberry men.

These entities formed various shapes such as a giant strawberry elephant, an ocean, fountains, clouds, hoops, and a steering wheel. The participant flew or swam through these formations, experiencing what seemed like hours or days of interaction with the entities. As they started coming out of the trip, they realized they were gripping the steering wheel of their car."
1378,13940,"The participant began their experience alone in a room after using an unknown substance through a makeshift water pipe. They reported losing touch with reality and entering a vivid state where colors appeared more intense and beautiful, glowing throughout the room. The participant saw tiny people engaged in various activities, which they perceived as part of their mind's construction of the environment. This visual experience was described as forming a circular pattern that eventually returned them to reality.

The trip lasted longer than expected and felt intensely immersive. Upon coming down from the experience, the participant reflected on it positively, noting that the tiny people were aspects of their own mind at work. They drew parallels between this experience and historical spiritual journeys, suggesting that approaching such experiences with an open mindset can lead to positive outcomes."
1379,12733,"The participant experienced heavy effects after consuming an unnamed substance in a familiar setting with friends. Physical sensations included feeling as though invisible ropes were pulling them down through the table, making it difficult to keep their upper body upright. Speech was significantly impaired, with the participant only able to say ""Dude..."" for an extended period. Visual perceptions became peculiar, with an emphasis on seeing inherent light in everything around them. Mental processes felt like a renaissance where past experiences did not matter. The experience lasted about 30 minutes before coming down, during which time speech and movement were regained within 15-20 minutes. Perception of the alternate reality continued for approximately 30 minutes after the effects began to subside."
1380,112866,"The participant began their experience in a dark wooded area near their house at around 3:45 A.M., feeling the world become plastic-like and encountering two entities - one male and one female. These entities communicated that the participant's universe was part of a larger structure, akin to a wheel with sections for different names and universes. The entities attempted to fold the participant's universe into smaller shapes, suggesting it was insignificant.

The participant felt as if they were losing their sense of self (ego-death) but managed to resist further folding by standing up and asserting defiance against the entities. After this act of resistance, the entities vanished, and the participant experienced a peaceful sensation in another dimension while still within their reality. They perceived waves through their back as wind moved through the trees, feeling it as if the tree roots were moving in an arc motion.

The experience concluded with the participant lying down for two minutes before coming inside to document the event, which they described as their most intense and vivid experience yet."
1381,70129,"The narrator and three friends took Salvia outdoors on what was supposed to be the narrator's 18th birthday. They purchased a gram of 20x potency Salvia from a smoke shop. The first friend to try it experienced immediate effects, becoming incoherent and excited about the substance. Another friend also tried it but did not report any significant effects.

The narrator then took a hit of Salvia and began experiencing visual distortions almost immediately. Their vision became choppy and lagged behind their movements. They felt as if they were on a moving disc or raft, with sensations of pressure at the back of their head and tingling in their forearms and hands. The experience was intense but did not include major hallucinations; instead, it featured severe visual distortions.

As the effects began to fade after about three minutes, the narrator felt altered but less intensely so. They observed that time seemed longer than it actually was. After the Salvia wore off, they smoked a blunt with their friends and then snorted cocaine, which further diminished any lingering effects of the Salvia.

The overall experience included mood elevation, sweating, flushing, laughter, visual and tactile distortions, ataxia (loss of motor control), blurred vision, and minor panic or anxiety."
1382,72225,"On Halloween night 2007, the participant experienced their first significant effect from an unknown substance after smoking half a gram of it in a bong. It took about 30 seconds for the effects to kick in. The participant felt changes and stood up halfway off the couch before being pulled back into it by some visual disturbance caused by poi lights.

The participant then heard what sounded like a computer shutting down and communicated with seven extra-dimensional beings who gathered above each other, similar to choir risers. These entities provided valuable information and directed the participant towards a portal that appeared on the left wall. The beings faded away as the portal disappeared, and the participant was lifted before returning to reality.

Upon return, the participant had a hot, sticky feeling all over their body but felt no discomfort. They quickly jumped up and yelled in surprise, causing reactions ranging from laughter to confusion among their friends. Since then, every experience with the substance has been meaningful, starting with a voice counting down or providing commentary on previous experiences.

The participant now owns a plant of this unknown substance and is dedicated to studying it further due to its ability to bring them face-to-face with extra-dimensional beings they believe are present but unacknowledged by most people."
1383,101593,"The participant experienced a mild dose of a substance that allowed them to feel connected to their childhood memories and reestablish forgotten associations. They were also able to merge with various elements in nature such as landscapes, sky, hills, quarries, and bird tunes. Additionally, the experience enabled them to connect with friends who are far away or ill.

During this session, the participant found themselves in a geometric shape resembling a truncated icosahedron, where their head and feet formed nodes and their body connected these points as edges. They were also periodically transformed into an expanding sphere within which they felt comfortable and at ease.

The participant engaged in conversation with an entity that communicated through spoken words despite the intention for internal speech. The dialogue centered around questions about personal growth and spiritual motivation. A golden yellow glow emanated from their chest, and they became acutely aware of their breathing, though not to the point of panic. They were advised by the entity that further learning would require managing this heightened awareness of breath."
1384,51029,"The participant smoked a large dose of an unnamed substance in a room with one other person. Within five seconds, they experienced disorientation and visual distortions. They felt as if they had broken through a dimensional rift and that higher powers were upset. The radio stopped playing music and a voice from it told the participant to sit back and not move. This increased their fear of a cosmic conspiracy against them. They attempted to stand up but then ran to the bedroom window to confirm that the outside world was still there. After realizing they could jump out, they almost did so before being reminded by their friend that they were under the influence of a drug. The experience lasted about two minutes and left the participant shaking, awestruck, and dumbfounded."
1385,72969,"The participant began the trip in a forest at night with an acquaintance. After inhaling the substance, they felt their body disintegrate into fine particles while remaining aware and not feeling fear. They then entered a multicolored world dominated by orange, populated by talking square-shaped entities with mouths that made atrocious sounds. The participant believed this was another dimension where spirits existed before going to Earth.

Suddenly, the participant realized their spirit would return to Earth in another body, possibly any form. Upon returning, they found themselves as a wall, sensing both sides of its surface and being immobile. As the effects wore off, the world around them began to recreate itself through a ribbon-like process that outlined objects but did not repeat over the same area.

The participant perceived everything as alive and heard thousands of voices singing, though it's unclear if they were seen, heard, or sensed. They communicated with these entities at times but knew they weren't real. Finally, the participant returned to reality, still confused and walking awkwardly in the dark forest."
1386,11131,"The participant smoked a substance and experienced immediate effects after the third hit. They felt as though something was enveloping them from behind, creating a sensation of movement and eventual engulfment. Visual hallucinations occurred, with the participant seeing an infinite wooden wall that folded into themselves. The experience was intense but did not reach the level of a full-blown trip as desired by the participant. Throughout the experience, the participant remained coherent and communicated their sensations to a friend who was present."
1387,51364,"The participant experienced a disintegration of their sense of self, feeling as though they were no longer confined to a physical body but instead became part of a spiraling kaleidoscope that extended into vast distances. They observed the smallest building blocks of reality breaking down and reassembling into intricate patterns. The participant attempted to name objects but found that doing so altered their perception of those objects.

The surface of the desk transformed into a rainforest, which rapidly changed through seasons until it became a wasteland of sand and dust, eventually being washed away by a single raindrop. Throughout these visual experiences, the participant encountered an entity described as having a slim face resembling a jester. This entity was perceived to be present in multiple aspects of reality, such as eyes and faces.

The experience concluded with the participant feeling reborn or deeply confused, attributing this to contact with what they believed to be an ancient, wise life-form trying to convey important information. The encounter left them contemplating the nature of these experiences and their potential significance for human understanding."
1388,88924,"The individual began by attempting a DMT experience but did not achieve breakthrough effects. They then decided to try Salvia, starting with 50 mg. During this first dose, they experienced mild euphoria and visual distortions, including their field of vision splitting into two regions. The second dose was 40 mg, which led to more pronounced effects: the world appeared cleaved into three identical versions, forming a kaleidoscope-like view. The participant felt as though they were part of the couch they were sitting on during this experience.

While under the influence, the individual communicated with their friend, repeatedly expressing that the experience was interesting and weird. As the effects wore off, one field of vision became dominant again, and the participant's coordination was impaired."
1389,87395,"The participant began their journey by chewing dried Salvia leaves for 25 minutes followed by drinking a strong tea made from additional leaves. This brought them to a mild level of altered consciousness (Level 1). They then smoked vaporized Salvia extract, which quickly elevated their experience to Level 2. At this stage, they perceived the world as folding and unfolding in a textured manner, accompanied by warmth and tingling sensations.

After another inhalation of the vaporized extract, the participant reached Level 3, experiencing rapid visual distortions and an overwhelming amount of information processing. They felt as if they were moving through different moments in time, with brief glimpses of potential past events or memories. The experience was intense but not described as a total loss of connection to reality.

A final inhalation brought the participant back to Level 1.5, where they remained until around 12:45 AM. During this period, they dozed off and on, experiencing fragmented dreams. Around 1 AM, they got up to eat and drink something before falling into a deeper sleep at about 2 AM. The next morning, the participant woke feeling wonderful and happy."
1390,105284,"The participant inhaled a substance through a metal pipe and felt intense physical sensations described as needles throughout their body. They assumed a lotus pose and observed their environment transform into rivers of flowing energy resembling neon Mesoamerican patterns on a black background. The participant experienced an overwhelming sense of connectedness to these energies, feeling that the energy flowed through them and all life around them, including their roommates. They felt capable of controlling this energy flow, such as potentially shutting off lights. This led to an omnipotent, evil-like sensation. After closing and reopening their eyes, the visual experience disappeared."
1391,103832,"The participant began their journey in a comfortable room playing a hand drum and expressing gratitude. They then used a 20x extract, experiencing numbness throughout the body and fading fractals. Three animated beings appeared with earthy gold, red, and black outlines. The being on the left gestured for more inhalation via water pipe. When the participant inhaled again, two other beings appeared, expressing happiness. One of them held out a mushroom resembling psilocybin, which the participant interpreted as a referral to another substance. The beings advised the participant to use natural, raw substances suited to their specific needs.

The images and impressions then disappeared, leaving the participant lucid but with thoughts about entheogens forming an interconnected network of consciousness. A red net appeared above the participant's head, possibly representing a barrier they wished to break through permanently. The participant pondered whether these entities take notes or triage based on individuals' intentions for using substances.

The experience concluded with the participant crashing into a deep sleep."
1392,48797,"The participant was on spring break in Florida when they tried an unnamed substance for the first time with friends. They took one large hit and immediately began experiencing intense effects. Their head felt like it was rolling and they heard a high-pitched noise, which they later realized was them screaming. The faces of their friends appeared two-dimensional and resembled Van Gogh's ""The Scream."" The participant had a sense of having two minds - one practical and one tripping out of control.

They walked over to a group of people in popped collars and told them to stop what they were doing, which confused the others. While looking for their sister, the participant saw purple crosses folding into the sand and felt tingling in their arms. They then hallucinated razor blades coming out of their lower back, which frightened them. The practical part of their mind urged them to come down from the experience.

The sister found the participant and they walked away together. The hallucinations eventually subsided, but the participant remained in an altered state for a while longer, feeling as though their head was floating and the ocean sounded amazing. Their body continued to feel tingly and refreshed."
1393,57420,"The participant consumed an unnamed substance in a 20 mg dose along with a friend. Initially, there were no effects for about an hour after ingestion. After one and a half hours, they experienced a slight buzzing high that was comforting and energizing. Around two hours into the experience, closed-eye visuals appeared.

For approximately six hours, the participant felt a combination of clarity of mind and euphoria similar to LSD or MDMA. They engaged in social activities and consumed alcohol, which slightly diminished the effects. Later, they smoked cannabis and then salvia, intensifying their experience. The salvia use led to exaggerated visual distortions and enhanced sensory perception.

The overall duration of the trip was extended due to the combination of substances, with open-eye visuals becoming more pronounced and vivid. The participant reported enjoying the experience and found it to be one of their best drug experiences ever."
1394,94987,"The participant began their experience with physical sensations of being divided into small cubes, which were described as jumping and organized into piles by tiny workers walking across the chest. This led to visual hallucinations where they found themselves in an Egyptian desert, seeing pyramids and entering a tomb filled with sarcophagi and gold. The experience then shifted to space, where they observed Earth from above, noting that each state of the United States appeared as different colors and morphed before their eyes. After realizing the need for oxygen, the participant returned to Earth, feeling as though hours or years had passed despite it only being around ten minutes. Post-experience, the individual felt slightly dizzy but used cannabis to manage any nausea."
1395,51544,"The participant consumed an unnamed substance and experienced several distinct encounters. In one instance, transparent people welcomed them into what felt like a more real world than their current life. These entities included a motherly figure and children. Another encounter involved a boy asking if they got enough and a woman helping them lay down. The participant also reported seeing multiple realities woven together on the ceiling. Each experience was followed by a return to normalcy, leaving questions about the nature of reality."
1396,64032,"Three individuals gathered around a campfire in Quebec city, Canada, consuming various substances including cannabis and an unnamed psychoactive substance. One participant rolled two joints containing the unnamed substance for himself and his friends to try. As they smoked, one friend experienced his jaw stretching out on the left side and felt gravity becoming strange. Another friend reported feeling as though he was being sucked down into his chair.

The narrator described experiencing a ""weird alien feeling"" with no stress but an unusual sensation. Visual effects were noted as exquisite, resembling origami-like structures unfolding in metallic qualities rather than organic fractals. The unnamed substance's effects peaked quickly and wore off after about 20 minutes. All participants found the experience enjoyable despite initial fears of intensity.

Afterwards, they rolled another joint and repeated the process, laughing throughout. No cravings for more were reported, and all returned to baseline within half an hour."
1397,41245,"The participant smoked a substance with friends after returning home from a night out. They experienced smooth and light tasting effects without harshness or coughing. After smoking several times, they felt unusual and continued smoking until finishing a gram between them. In the living room, they discussed various topics including an intriguing drinks lid, dimensions, variables, and shapes on a piece of paper that were not cylindrical but other unidentifiable forms.

They then had an introspective discussion about their lives from birth to present, focusing on significant images and relating them to words like aggression, hesitance, and ignorance. The friend formulated these into the shape of a camel with functions such as humps for water storage, feet for surface area, and coat for climate changes. They linked the three words to the parts of the camel's shape.

The participant concluded that all thought processes are learned from external sources through visual perception, physical experience, or information from others. This led them to believe that none of their thoughts are truly their own and that they are products of a chain of influences. The realization was that individuals are not unique but rather shaped by genetic and environmental factors."
1398,90345,"The participant consumed a substance in multiple forms over several attempts: chewing, swallowing, and smoking. Each attempt resulted in minimal to no noticeable effects apart from general disorientation and the sensation of being poked by invisible needles. No visual or auditory hallucinations were reported. The individual has high tolerance for other psychoactive substances like DMT crystals, ayahuasca, salvia, mushrooms, LSA, and Psilocybin. They noted that the substance in question only slightly enhances experiences when used as a catalyst with LSA and Psilocybin."
1399,12283,"The individual begins by inhaling smoke from salvia leaves and experiences an immediate onset of intense sensations. They feel disoriented and confused, questioning their identity and surroundings. Vivid imagery appears, including twisting canyons, spiraling galaxies, and gaudy colors in red, green, and yellow forming zig-zag patterns. The visuals are described as resembling a romper room Vegas casino gameshow.

Entities appear suddenly from the background, morphing into form. These entities are not explicitly described but seem to be running the show and are more 'real' than the real world. The participant experiences fear and terror while falling into what they perceive as the 6th dimension or the 'true' reality. They feel petrified and unable to react, even experiencing a loss of fight-or-flight instinct.

The trip then shifts, with brief flashes of a familiar room approaching from afar. This leads to a reconstruction of a lower-dimensional fairy-tale-like environment. The participant remembers taking salvia and expresses reluctance to return to the 'real' world, believing that the other dimension was more authentic. They feel exhilarated by fear and question whether higher forces are at work."
1400,66831,"The participant took three tokes of an unknown substance and immediately experienced vivid hallucinations. They saw objects from their childhood, such as an old chair, spinning in front of them. They felt heavy and clumsy, unable to move easily. The bed appeared to have grown around them, requiring effort to climb out. Upon reaching the floor, they perceived lush green fields, dark overgrown forests, garden gnomes, demons with clawing faces, and heard singing elves. There were also sensory experiences like an arrow being shot across plains and trees stretching a hammock.

The participant's wife, acting as a sitter, became upset when the participant tried to involve her in the experience by encouraging her to join them. She eventually left but returned after a few seconds, still angry. The participant managed to reassure their wife that they were fine before attempting to explain the voyage, though she was not receptive.

The experience lasted for about 30 minutes, during which time the participant felt as if the altered state was more real than the physical world."
1401,78573,"Three friends, including the narrator, decided to try a new substance together at the narrator's mother's house. The narrator had previous experience with this substance and guided their friends through the process. During the first session, Keisha experienced significant effects, becoming incoherent and drooling. The narrator felt intense fear and disorientation, seeing colorful outlines around objects and experiencing a perception of being one with a wooden table knot. They also saw themselves moving between different colored worlds that became suffocating as they transitioned back to reality.

In the second session, the narrator and Keisha smoked separately from Ash. The narrator again experienced visual hallucinations similar to the first trip but this time identified more closely with the object (the knot in the table). They had difficulty coming out of the trip despite trying to use Ash's voice for guidance."
1402,45822,"The narrator describes their first experience with an unnamed substance while at home in their room, with their cousin present. Initially, the cousin tried mild and medium doses of the substance before switching roles. The narrator then smoked the substance and experienced visual distortions, including becoming one with a 3D cube on their computer screen and passing through what appeared to be a solid wall of color. They heard an unknown voice calling out to them but saw no one when they turned around. After standing up, they felt as though gravity was pushing them forward wherever they walked. The narrator's cousin had left the room during this time. When able to speak clearly again, the narrator asked their cousin if they had spoken to them during the experience, and the cousin said no."
1403,63977,"The participant experienced a first-time encounter with an unknown substance at a music festival. They accepted a pipe from someone they had just met and inhaled the contents, which tasted like hay. Shortly after inhaling, the participant began to feel unwell, experiencing numbness that felt like cold metal beads dripping down their sides and a sensation of electricity. Their vision became restricted, and they heard an intense roaring sound as if the world was ripping apart. The participant felt as though everything was tumbling forward, leading them to believe they were falling.

The individual called out for help and frantically tried to hold onto someone or something, but could not feel their own body. Friends held the person up, but the participant perceived this support as unstable, with everything slipping away at odd angles. There was a moment of panic where the participant felt their mind merging with the field and feared they would never return to known reality.

As the experience progressed, the participant slowly started to come back to reality. They began laughing uncontrollably out of happiness at returning to normalcy, though still somewhat disoriented. The individual expressed concern about taking the substance in such an uncomfortable environment and mentioned planning to try it again at home under more controlled conditions."
1404,71096,"The participant consumed an unspecified substance in a shed with a friend. They reported experiencing rapid, disjointed thoughts centered around discovering the ""secret of time."" After what felt like finding this secret, they perceived everything glowing briefly before entering a state where time seemed slowed and moments were repeated. This sensation gradually diminished until it disappeared completely."
1405,63104,"The participant experienced vivid closed-eye visuals (CEVs) and visual distortions, including walls that appeared to breathe and move inward toward them. They also perceived a menacing female presence but could not clearly identify it at the time. After the peak of the experience, they continued to see CEVs featuring silhouettes of people walking in a jumbled crowd and monochrome hallways with many doors on either side."
1406,112142,"The individual began their experience by smoking a large dose of an unspecified psychedelic substance from a bong. Immediately after exhaling, they noticed visual distortions: objects appeared warped and distant. Within one minute, the effects intensified; the participant felt as though they were inside a Jimi Hendrix poster on the wall, experiencing intense colors and disorienting visuals.

The individual struggled to remember basic concepts such as what a human being is or their own identity. They repeatedly asked aloud, ""What did I take?"" for several minutes, seemingly unaware of their surroundings and friend's presence. After about ten minutes, they began to regain some sense of reality, first recognizing that they were on a psychedelic substance (likely LSD), then recalling memories associated with their father.

It took approximately 15 more minutes for the participant to return to a somewhat normal mental state. Throughout this period, they experienced confusion and relearning familiar concepts. The effects lingered for about half an hour after the initial intense phase. The experience was described as overwhelming and not euphoric, leading the individual to never repeat it despite having other psychedelic experiences since."
1407,25069,"The individual experienced a strong sensation of numbness around the mouth shortly after ingesting an unspecified substance. This was followed by visual disturbances, including bright lights in peripheral vision and vivid hallucinations where red pork chops with wings appeared to fly out of the television screen. The participant found this experience comical rather than frightening. After these intense effects subsided, they felt a stoned sensation for about one hour before the effects fully dissipated."
1408,63336,"The user and their husband first tried Amanita caps, which provided a mellow high without trippy effects. They then experimented with Salvia; the husband experienced seeing many people walking around whom he thought were real. The user felt her arms being pulled by their sides as if the skin was stretching and had difficulty talking but later burst into uncontrollable laughter.

The next night, after smoking more Amanita caps, the user took another dose of Salvia alone in her bedroom. She experienced vivid hallucinations where she felt like she was in a concession stand at a beach with legs sliced vertically and submerged in thick liquid, making walking difficult. She perceived a female entity that seemed to be slicing her legs because they were food. The experience was described as extremely bizarre and unsettling."
1409,56345,"The participant experienced a vivid scenario where they felt as if they were on an imaginary train passing through their room. They perceived two entities: an old man with a grey beard standing about 6 feet behind the train and a girl at the controls. The train was moving chugging sounds, and the participant begged the girl to stop it but she did not comply. The train moved towards a wall leading to an unknown land filled with euphoria and happiness. Despite this, the participant feared losing grip of reality and tried to convince the girl to take their sister along as well. When the train disappeared through the wall, the participant ran to their sister's room, but could only control one side of their body properly, which frightened her."
1410,67046,"The individual started their experience alone in a quiet room at 3:45 PM. They initially felt heavy on the right side with grid-like visuals appearing. After taking another dose, they experienced severe disorientation and fear. At 4:05 PM, they perceived their world as being pulled into a black hole, believing that their existence was fake and about to be cancelled. They imagined friends and family already in this void, telling them it was inevitable. The individual fought against this sensation, screaming for help until the experience subsided. Upon recovery, they disposed of the remaining substance out of fear."
1411,51323,"The individual prepared for their experience by setting up dimmed colored lights and selecting calming music. They inhaled smoke from a pipe filled with an extract, experiencing immediate intense effects within 15 seconds. The world began to disintegrate visually, causing panic as they feared waking family members or expressing concern about friends and family.

Regaining some consciousness, the participant took another hit but felt unable to continue smoking. Lying on their bed, they experienced multiple dimensions, including one where they perceived themselves as ground with people walking over them in a 16th-century marketplace setting. The experience was overwhelming and frightening, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes before gradually subsiding.

After the effects lessened, the individual regained balance and communicated their experience to friends online, becoming sober within about 10 minutes of the initial onset."
1412,10808,"The participant began their experience by lying awake at night with an urge to escape reality. After consuming the substance, they experienced a floaty sensation similar to laughing gas. While on the bed, they observed patterns where blue flowers turned red and green. Moving to the computer, they focused on winamp visuals, perceiving them as evergreen trees and a lake, creating a landscape that evolved through seasons. They felt immersed in this world, forgetting about reality and their surroundings. After the experience, they were lost but wanted their created world back. They were amazed by their artistic and imaginative abilities during the trip and felt it provided insight into life."
1413,17149,"The participant tried a substance three times. The first two attempts resulted in mild effects including slight loss of coordination and difficulty thinking clearly. On the third attempt, after consuming four large doses, they experienced an escalating tingling sensation that became intense enough to feel like being electrocuted. This was described as uncomfortable. No visions or interesting sensations were reported during any of the experiences."
1414,111277,"The participant had two separate experiences with a substance. In the first experience, they ingested 4 seeds sublingually after fasting for several hours. Effects were felt about an hour later, characterized by intense euphoria and a body high. The participant smoked marijuana to enhance the effects, which added to the sensations of vibrations throughout their body. Music was enjoyable but there were no visual distortions or altered perceptions. The peak lasted 2-3 hours before gradually subsiding.

In the second experience, the participant ingested 8 seeds sublingually after a late and light dinner, leading to dehydration. They experienced slight stomach discomfort and smoked marijuana with additional herbs (chilean holly, mugwort, wormwood, calea) around 2.5 hours later. This resulted in lethargy, erratic thoughts, impaired motor functions, and intense hunger. The participant felt restless for about an hour before consuming salvia leaves through a bong. This led to a period of disorientation where they felt like different characters and experienced difficulty breathing, jumbled thoughts, and physical immobility. These symptoms lasted 2.5 hours before gradually improving. Negative thoughts persisted until around 11 PM when normalcy was restored."
1415,90588,"The individual begins to notice changes in perception as lines start to blur between self and surroundings. They see two-dimensional visions and feel a sense of splitting or being conjoined within a void. During this time, they experience rapid heartbeat and sweating, leading to a feeling of falling into an unknown realm where they simultaneously feel both singular and connected to everything else. Memory loss occurs during the peak of the experience, but the person accepts their situation and understands the futility of trying to escape. The experience concludes with a return to normalcy."
1416,71984,"The participant experienced their first encounter with an unknown substance in a calm environment while sitting in bed with a sitter present. They consumed two hits of another substance before taking a small dose of the unknown substance. Approximately 20 seconds after ingestion, they reported vivid visual hallucinations including a rotating, cartoon-like alligator figure that changed colors and moved like a flipping Rolodex. The participant also heard the distant voice of their sitter during this experience. After about five minutes, reality began to return, leaving them sweaty. One hour later, most effects had subsided."
1417,22470,"The participant attended a house-warming party where they consumed an unspecified substance along with five others. After finishing their dose, they engaged in philosophical discussions about consciousness and the absolute. A friend introduced another substance through a pipe, which was described as a 'healthy dose'. The first sensation experienced was a whooshing sound followed by visual hallucinations of the front door and part of the surrounding wall being sucked into a screaming vortex. This was accompanied by an intense wind, causing the participant to lean back with bulging eyes but without fear.

The physical world then appeared to turn liquid and boil, making people around them look more ridiculous than usual. The friend who had also taken the substance experienced their face splitting horizontally as they laughed at the participant's face doing the same thing. As the trip progressed, the participant became aware of a lattice of cubes 'in' everything, sensing rather than seeing them directly. They could feel these cube-like shapes passing through objects and even their own body, extending into infinity."
1418,28109,"The participant consumed mushrooms and later inhaled salvia while tripping. During the peak of the experience, they saw a woman's face multiplied many times, which appeared beautiful and all-knowing. The participant felt joy and understanding from this vision but could not communicate effectively with it. After the trip ended, the participant reported feeling as though the entity was watching them and encouraging their search for truth."
1419,25201,"The participant experienced their fifth or sixth use of a substance in extract form, with previous experiences being less intense. They smoked a small amount of cannabis about ten minutes prior but were not significantly affected by it. A friend was present as a sitter but proved to be inexperienced and distracting during the trip.

After inhaling the substance through a pipe, the participant felt an uncomfortable ""pulling"" sensation, as if being drawn in multiple directions simultaneously. They observed a black void-like area in their room that seemed to pull everything towards it. The tingling sensation on their skin became increasingly uncomfortable, and visual distortions occurred, with objects appearing to ripple.

The sitter's interruptions, including asking questions and showing websites, disrupted the experience and caused frustration for the participant. These distractions reduced the intensity of the effects. After running out of the substance, the participant was left with a mild cannabis high from earlier use."
1420,81378,"The participant entered their roommate's small room and smoked a large amount of an unidentified substance from a bowl. Within seconds, they felt disoriented and began drooling uncontrollably. The walls appeared to move inward, making the room seem smaller. They were confused and did not remember taking the drug during the experience.

While listening to Jimi Hendrix on the computer with visual effects playing in the background, the participant became fixated on colorful flying images that surrounded them. They felt as though Jimi was trying to communicate something but could not understand it. The trip lasted a few minutes and was described as both fun and scary."
1421,18074,"The participant had two experiences with a psychoactive substance. The first occurred over a year ago when they smoked an extract of the substance using a bong. Neither the participant nor their friend experienced any noticeable effects. Three months prior to the report, the participant tried again with fresh leaves in a pipe, this time with two friends. They expected intense experiences based on online reports but only felt slightly more effects than before. No entities were encountered during either experience."
1422,51718,"The participant and two friends took an unknown substance for the first time. During the initial dosage, the participant experienced uncontrollable laughter lasting about five minutes and visual distortions caused by shadows from candles. Ten minutes after the effects subsided, the participant felt completely sober.

On a subsequent day, the participant had another experience with a higher dose. This time, they immediately noticed spinning and blurring visuals before lying down on their bed. While lying on the bed, the participant encountered an entity described as a lady with long curly hair appearing in black silhouettes. The entity seemed to want to take the participant's soul somewhere, but the participant resisted, feeling energy around them trying to ""get back"" to their body."
1423,63926,"The participants went into the woods to use a drug in a makeshift bong. After taking their first hit, one participant saw an outline of their body moving away from the tree they were leaning against, feeling rejected by it. They then experienced a dreamy state and laughed at their friend who thought he had wet himself but was actually just spilling water.

They moved to another spot where both participants took hits from the bong again. The first participant felt surrounded by many living forms and saw two trees: one male mixing the ground like soup, and a female educating the male about the presence of the participant. Both trees then looked at the participant with an overwhelming sensation of acceptance.

The second participant took another hit and drank the leftover bong water, confusing it for more drug. He ran off but stopped to smile at his friend before they walked back together. The first participant experienced a tree smiling at them and speaking, asking if this was what they expected."
1424,11968,"The participant began the experience with two inhalations from a bong containing an unenhanced leaf substance. After lying down and closing their eyes, they experienced visual hallucinations of a pole-like structure emerging from the ground in a parabolic curve, displacing dirt around it. They felt invited on a journey by a family of Native Americans, particularly an older woman. The participant was apprehensive about joining but decided to end the experience after 20 minutes and discussed their observations with their friend Tom."
1425,27490,"The participant and friends consumed alcohol and marijuana before using an extract substance. The individual smoked the extract in a bong while listening to ambient music. Upon inhaling, they experienced intense visual distortions characterized by geometric patterns and a sense of everything being perfectly clean and structured. They felt detached from their body, as if their head was moving forward while their body remained stationary. This led to an experience of feeling like a box on a conveyor belt in a factory setting.

The participant communicated these sensations to a friend who had also used the substance. The friend laughed uncontrollably before describing his own experience, which involved feeling like a bag rather than a box. Both individuals found humor in their shared but distinct perceptions during the trip."
1426,63429,"The participant experienced an intense visual and dissociative state after ingesting the substance. Initially standing on a dirt road looking at a bridge, they felt as though they had become part of the right side wall of the bridge, unable to move or breathe but without panic. The bridge then rotated around them, pulling them along its top surface. During this time, there was strong visual and dissociative effect; the participant could experience everything happening but also observe it from a detached perspective.

The participant experienced an intense air thirst, possibly due to not breathing properly during the experience. They were expelled from the bridge as if spat out, quickly returning to their normal state in their room. The overall experience was described as novel and involving triangular brown bridges."
1427,23034,"The participant began their experience after consuming an unspecified substance for approximately 2-3 hours. They then inhaled a potent extract, experiencing immediate visual effects including flying through an ancient Mayan courtyard with colorful glyphs. A second inhalation intensified the experience, causing them to feel as if they had shifted into another reality.

Over the next 3-4 hours, the participant reported constant physical movement and frequent shifts between different versions of themselves within the same room. These shifts were described as transitions into new realities. The experience was accompanied by a profound sense of the possibility of death, not in a negative way but as a release from the perceived constraints of reality.

The participant eventually returned to normalcy after significant effort, followed by an introspective phase where they reflected on their experience. They concluded that every decision and action creates new parallel universes of possibility, suggesting that our reality is dynamic rather than static."
1428,47101,"The participant smoked an unspecified amount of a substance using a water pipe and held their breath for 20 to 30 seconds per hit as instructed. They experienced physical sensations similar to being drunk, with loose arms and legs. No hallucinations were reported, and the effects did not last long. The user felt disappointed by the lack of intense experiences compared to expectations."
1429,91605,"The participant smoked an unknown substance for the first time and immediately put on a blindfold before lying down. Within five minutes, they began to sweat profusely through their blindfold and felt extreme discomfort, describing it as ""sheer terror."" The experience lasted approximately 4-5 minutes in total."
1430,14354,"The participant began by using regular leaves and experienced mild disorientation. They then used a small amount of extract from Siebert's product. Upon inhalation, they immediately felt transported to another dimension or world characterized by an all-encompassing swirl of energy. This experience included a perceived boundary line running through their being, with two sides struggling for dominance: one attempting to pull them in and the other holding them steady.

The participant was surrounded by a bright-orange swirling mass of energy that defied description. They heard a voice in their head asking what they were doing there, questioning their purpose in this dimension. After about five minutes, the experience ended abruptly, and the participant returned to reality, noticing ripples on the bed as if from an aftereffect.

Upon reviewing the audio recording, it was noted that there was a 5-minute gap of silence during which the participant was presumably experiencing the altered state."
1431,66750,"The individual smoked a concentrated dose from dried leaves. Initially, they experienced a sensation of pressure on the corners of their eyes and a feeling that everything was compressed or molded down. After about two to three minutes, these sensations subsided, and the participant observed their surroundings in a garden setting. The view appeared filmic, black and white, still, without luster, wind, or sense of time. Plants did not rustle or shine. There was an awareness of the presence of the plant used but no direct communication."
1432,16195,"The participant smoked a substance using a bong with about four leaves. They experienced mild hallucinations and physical sensations similar to other hallucinogens like mushrooms or LSD but found the effects not as strong as expected. After the initial effects wore off, they felt discomfort in their head for around half an hour."
1433,11178,"The individual began by smoking a substance through a pipe while at home with their wife. After inhaling deeply, they felt detached and experienced visual distortions described as ""tunnelling."" The participant reported feeling giggly and finding the situation humorous. They then took another hit, which intensified the experience. Upon opening their eyes, they felt a sense of returning to a higher state of awareness where everyday concerns like work and money seemed unimportant. This realization was reassuring rather than depressing.

The individual attempted to convey this altered perception to their wife but found it difficult to articulate due to its abstract nature. They expressed reverence for the substance, describing it as a powerful herb that provides a unique experience compared to other substances they have tried. The participant mentioned feeling 'homesick' for this state after returning to normal consciousness and looking forward to future experiences."
1434,105327,"The individual consumed an unidentified substance and experienced leaving their body, traveling through space to see a spiral galaxy. Upon returning to their body, they found the television set talking to them in a distorted voice, warning of wrongdoing. They perceived an alien presence within themselves. Visual distortions included letters forming a whirlpool and exiting the room through a window. Pink stars rotated around them, emitting an electric noise. The individual experienced confusion about their identity, seeing two versions of themselves simultaneously. Post-trip effects lasted for several months, including difficulty concentrating."
1435,49229,"The participant reported feeling part of an interconnected fabric, similar to a zipper, where time ceased to exist. They perceived this fabric as God and believed that everything around them, including their friends who appeared as zipper-like entities, was created by themselves in a delusion. The experience made the narrator question which reality is real - the one they have lived for 35 years or the one experienced during the trip."
1436,25711,"The participant inhaled Salvia through a water bong and experienced an intense, surreal reality shift. They felt a cold, metallic sensation spreading throughout their body before losing touch with the physical world. In this altered state, they perceived themselves as scissors trapped under a door covered in glue, attempting to clean up but unable due to their form. Upon opening their eyes, they believed they had lost their head and were trying to reattach it while seeing others as bottles of detergent. The voices around them felt like waves of energy that sliced through them, causing confusion and anxiety. One person's voice was particularly disturbing, prompting the participant to tell them to leave. After about five minutes, the participant fled outside for relief."
1437,85103,"The participant first tried the substance with cannabis, but did not feel significant effects. On a second attempt without cannabis, they used about 1/6g and felt an onset similar to LSD. The experience included profound visual and auditory sensations, as well as a mental state of detachment from reality. They perceived man-made structures being peeled away, revealing natural patterns beneath. There was also a sensation akin to the head or body being turned inside out. Subsequent experiences were different but similarly positive, with no disorienting effects except for an initial blast-off phase. The participant felt capable of moving around easily and experienced increased energy after the effects began to taper."
1438,110273,"The individual sat in a forest during sunset and smoked an extract from a pipe. They experienced a disorienting sensation where their body, mind, and soul fragmented into pieces forming part of a combination lock on the horizon. This was accompanied by intense fear described as ""terror, terror, terror."" The experience then shifted to a guiding presence that reassembled the individual's physical form and mental identity, likening it to slipping back into a warm bath. The entity communicated with the participant, referring to them as a ""silly, fragile little creature"" and invited them to return soon."
1439,85449,"The experience began with the user smoking a substance, experiencing a strong onset within two minutes. During this period, they felt strange body sensations such as sinking or splitting in half and saw a flashing circle in their field of vision that appeared to dance around. After about one minute, they became lucid again while watching a TV show featuring their wife and children. The user mistakenly believed the characters on the screen were themselves and their future family. They felt an intense feeling of universal love for a brief moment before it subsided. The experience concluded with the realization that no one would understand what they had experienced, but they found peace in this understanding."
1440,107300,"The participant had multiple experiences over 36 days, smoking the substance three or more times daily. In one experience, they saw a planet rushing towards them, then found themselves in an orange tube landscape with spinning faces in holes looking at TV screens on the ground. They felt good while spinning and watching their screen but were sad to return to reality. The last trip involved being thrown into a prism of mixing colors where they felt torn apart into a red color wheel with needles in every atom of their body. This experience left them with HPPD for several months afterwards."
1441,86971,"The participant experienced an immediate shift in perception, feeling detached from their surroundings as if they were being pulled away. They observed their heartbeat and blood circulation, noting changes in color from burgundy to purple before transitioning into total darkness. A voice representing their conscience emerged, conveying the message ""You are the universe,"" which triggered a rush of energy and emotional awareness.

The participant then dove into an underwater environment where they could breathe effortlessly. Encountering approximately 40-50 large sea turtles, they interacted with one by touching its shell and making eye contact. The turtle smiled reassuringly, allowing for telepathic communication that conveyed the idea of unity between all living beings.

As the group moved faster, a warped dimension appeared, and the participant began to feel reconnected with reality as their eyes started to open again."
1442,100055,"The participant prepared dried leaves from clones under fluorescent light, removing stems before crumbling them into powder. This powder was added to a bong with cold water for inhalation. The first hit had subtle effects, but the second produced significant changes in perception. The individual experienced a desire to flow with an energy that played with light and color when their eyes were closed. They felt a flowing energy that helped focus."
1443,69460,"At around 2:30 am, the participant began to feel the effects of a psychedelic substance they had previously used once before. They sat down due to the overwhelming sensation of their body expanding across various planes of existence. The experience was accompanied by intense fear and a feeling of being trapped on a rug made from their own body, stretched across the universe.

The participant perceived layers of textureless colors blending together, attempting to climb over these layers while hearing persecuting laughter and awkward stares around them. They gripped onto what they thought was a couch but later realized was a crutch for reality. The fear of nonexistence increased as a weight pressed on their chest.

To return to consciousness, the participant validated their existence by stating their name aloud (""I'm Drew Carlson""). This action allowed shapeless beings with faint voices and vague opinions to help fold the participant's body back into existence. Upon regaining consciousness, they experienced kaleidoscope patterns and uncontrollable laughter due to relief from the intense experience."
1444,82761,"The individual found themselves in a dark, empty space, feeling detached from their previous life and emotions. They perceived themselves as a superior being drifting through blackness. A spiral was observed moving in front of them, which they believed would be the only thing seen again in that darkness. The experience felt dreamlike, with the participant believing they would wake up to this reality after death."
1445,70644,"The participant purchased a plant from a garden store that resembled salvia divinorum but had red leaves. They dried the leaves by placing them on a pan in an oven at 170 degrees for about 15 minutes, then crushed and rolled them into a joint which they smoked entirely. After smoking, the individual felt slightly relaxed and somewhat tired. About twenty minutes later, they experienced a mild headache."
1446,50886,"Three friends gathered in a field to consume an unnamed substance. The narrator was the second person to take a hit and immediately felt disoriented, experiencing a tunnel vision effect with blonde hair as its focal point. During this state, visual thoughts extended from the tunnel of hair to connect with their friends' stomachs when they spoke. This lasted approximately five minutes.

After regaining clarity, the narrator felt confused about having ever used drugs before. Henry reported seeing the narrator as Jimi Hendrix and being trapped in a cage by him. Buddy experienced rain that appeared to be lemonade during his trip, despite actual sunny weather conditions. The narrator also noted an unusual accumulation of saliva with an odd taste during their experience."
1447,73325,"The participant experienced their first encounter with a substance obtained from salvia splendens. They prepared five dried flowers and inhaled them over three hits. Initially, after about 30 seconds, they felt bodily heaviness accompanied by slight visual effects. The subsequent two hits intensified the sensation of heaviness, which was described as being between that of another substance (referred to as ""salvia div"" and ""dxm"") and lasted for approximately ten minutes. After this period, the participant reported feeling very happy and positive for about two hours. No hangover or withdrawal symptoms were noted after the experience."
1448,12270,"The participant inhaled a substance and immediately felt a shift in perception, experiencing their room as part of a larger mechanical system. They then entered what appeared to be an 1800s toy factory but were pushed back into a red cell resembling their own room with altered characteristics. The room began turning like a gear in a machine, and the participant tried to escape before it turned again. After about three minutes, they returned to reality. Upon returning, they noticed that the doors of their closets were morphing and moving within the room. By focusing their attention, they could control these visual distortions."
1449,45517,"The individual reported an intense experience characterized by vivid hallucinations and a strong feeling of disorientation. Upon inhaling the substance, they immediately felt detached from their surroundings and experienced visual distortions such as seeing the rug on the wall attempting to digest their friends. They believed they were in another dimension and perceived their friends as being from this alternate reality. The experience lasted approximately 10-15 minutes during which time the individual spoke nonsensically about topics that did not relate to their current state of mind, such as Christmas presents and a pet cat. Friends reported interacting with the individual by playing tricks on them, which may have contributed to the unsettling feeling experienced during the trip."
1450,61729,"The participant took a single dose of an unnamed substance sublingually at 5:30 AM. They reported no immediate effects, describing the taste as slightly bitter but familiar from previous experiences. The individual listened to music while waiting for potential effects, which did not occur. At around 6:15 AM, they swallowed their saliva and continued to wait, still experiencing no changes in perception or mood. By 6:48 AM, they expressed frustration at the lack of effect and speculated about possible immunity due to previous military service (though this was noted as a joke). They fell asleep shortly after, waking up around 12 PM with no reported effects from the substance."
1451,24917,"A group of friends were at a party where one individual, referred to as Eggroll, decided to try an unknown substance after consuming mushrooms and marijuana. After taking the first hit, Eggroll's behavior became erratic; he repeatedly asked ""What?"" and ""Huh?"", stood up then sat back down, squeezed his friend's arm intensely, and attempted to open a door but was flung out when it opened. Inside, Eggroll grabbed onto another person, Kat, tightly while talking incoherently.

During the trip, Eggroll reported seeing himself put his head down in slow motion and experiencing pleasant sensations initially. However, as the effects intensified, he felt his mind unraveling and reality slipping away. He believed he was in a line with other beings referred to as ""matrix kids,"" who were also throwing up solid masses. This led him to feel as though he was being pulled into the land of the dead, causing extreme fear and distress."
1452,41905,"The participant initially took an unspecified substance, leading to a brief loss of consciousness. Upon regaining awareness, they experienced a period of intense positive sensations lasting about six hours. They then consumed the substance again in the presence of friends, which resulted in confusion and disorientation for one friend who described it as feeling like falling off a cliff. The participant reported experiencing visual distortions including control over colors appearing neon bright. There were no detailed interactions with specific entities mentioned beyond the general state of mind and brief mention of another person's reaction."
1453,57085,"The participant experienced their first encounter with a hallucinogenic substance, which included visual and auditory hallucinations, laughter, and an altered state of consciousness. Following this experience, they began having frequent vivid nature-themed dreams lasting over two weeks. In these dreams, various animals such as dogs, puppies, owls, eagles, coyotes, wolves, and elephants appeared and could communicate with the participant through speech or telepathy. The dreams also featured atmospheric elements like talking clouds with faces, bright full moons, blue skies, oscillating rainbows, slowly pouring clouds over mountain tops, and shimmering heat effects in the air."
1454,30552,"The participant smoked two joints containing an unnamed substance at home. Following the first joint, they experienced a floating sensation and laughed at a rice grain for about a minute. After smoking the second joint, the only effect reported was a continued feeling of floating and happiness. The entire experience lasted approximately 6-7 minutes."
1455,51567,"The participant reported leaving the room they were in and entering a spinning environment where they felt connected to other people by an invisible string. They compared themselves to a tooth in a zipper, pulling away from adjacent teeth (people). In this altered state, they perceived their family around them, who told them that they could now see the ""big picture"" of reality. As the experience ended, the participant experienced tingling sensations throughout their body and felt calm for approximately 20 minutes."
1456,53511,"The participant experienced a relaxing effect after smoking dried leaves from a Salvia Splendens plant. The effects included a heavy sensation in the eyes, slight fogginess in the head, and overall relaxation. Smoking the substance in a joint was found to be more tolerable compared to direct inhalation."
1457,10756,"After consuming an unknown substance, the participant felt as if they were falling at increasing speed. They then saw an Egyptian tomb in their room. An entity appeared: a boy named Kit, who spoke in a thick accent and said ""Snip yer knitter ay laddie?"" (chop your dick off) before running away. The participant laughed and eventually fell asleep."
1458,10314,"The individual reported feeling an uncomfortable friction within their body as if particles were rubbing against each other. They then experienced a distortion of their body shape, with arms twisting into a double helix and spiraling off into infinity. A massive tree appeared before them, towering vertically through what resembled the center of a galaxy. The participant's legs ascended into the tree trunk while their head descended into its roots, resulting in a near-complete merging with the tree except for the top of their head. As the effects wore off, they returned to a more familiar state of consciousness."
1459,23258,"The participant consistently enters an alternate reality during each session. In this reality, they feel as though they are neglecting another life when coming down from the effects. The alternate reality takes place in front of a garage where the individual is working on a car, specifically fixing the bumper. There are recurring strange beings present in this alternate reality."
1460,10208,"After smoking the substance, the individual immediately felt its effects, causing them to march around the room with their eyes closed for about a minute and a half. They then sat on the bed and continued their trip. A silhouette appeared in front of them, holding an object resembling a baseball bat. The figure repeatedly struck the participant with the bat, but they did not feel it; instead, they saw flashes of purple light each time. This interaction caused the participant to laugh uncontrollably until they eventually opened their eyes and returned to sobriety."
1461,8332,"The participant attempted to use a tincture multiple times. The first attempt was mild with no significant effects. On the second attempt, after abstaining from medication for 24 hours, they experienced visual distortions and sweating while at work. They found it difficult to understand text on a screen but could communicate verbally without issue. Walking across a flat parking lot felt like climbing an incline. The experience lasted about 30 minutes before returning to normal."
1462,17512,"The participant smoked an extract of a substance and experienced immediate effects. They felt their mind being taken over by an unseen entity described as blue, struggling against a green 'f'-shaped entity surrounded by concentric circles of white and green. The participant had difficulty walking due to an unseen force pulling them into the wall and stairs.

Physical sensations included pins-and-needles feelings starting in the face and spreading throughout the body. Upon entering their room, they lost contact with reality and saw a vertical grid of beings representing thoughts, each colored differently based on importance. Blue beings were of middle importance, while red ones represented unimportant thoughts far from the door leading back to reality.

Occasionally, these thought-beings would be sucked through the door into physical action. The participant eventually returned to their body after being pulled through the door themselves. Pins-and-needles sensations gradually faded over 20 minutes as normalcy was regained."
1463,17086,"The individual smoked a small amount of an extract in a pipe while sitting outside on their balcony. Initially, they felt nothing but after taking another hit, the world became distorted. They perceived themselves as sinking into the balcony floor and wall, becoming trapped there for eternity. In the distance, they saw two scenes: one from an old house and another from a store. The individual panicked, fearing that moving would destroy everything, including their mother.

They managed to move indoors, walking on their head, and reached the stairwell without noticing the stairs. They fell down the stairs but did not feel pain at the time. Upon landing in the hall, they opened the front door and saw their dog, which helped them return inside. The individual was sweating profusely and decided to take a shower after cleaning up the balcony and disposing of the pipe and remaining extract."
1464,8847,"The individual began their experience by smoking dried leaves from a pipe. They immediately noticed a change in perspective similar to other substances they had tried before. Physical sensations included heat around areas of the body touching the floor. Closing their eyes led to an intense feeling of being pulled horizontally through what felt like a tube or drain, described as amazing but disappointing when it ended quickly. The experience was interrupted by household cats meowing and surrounding the individual's head on the floor."
1465,8960,"The individual reported feeling as though their body was launched into space during the experience, similar to a roller coaster but in reverse direction. They felt briefly as if they had left their body, although this sensation lasted only about ten seconds. Afterward, they described feeling grounded yet not fully sober, with an overwhelming sense of well-being and emotional relief lasting for five to ten minutes."
1466,31885,"The participant consumed an extract of a substance refined to several times its normal strength through inhalation using a waterpipe without water. After two hits, each lasting for 20 seconds, they began to disassociate from their surroundings about one minute after the second hit. Their room appeared as a cavern and there was an overwhelming silence. The participant experienced rapid mental activity, unable to form coherent thoughts or feelings. They felt as if they were running but standing still, with increased heart rate and sweating. After approximately 10 minutes, the intensity decreased, and the participant entered a neutral state of mind similar to that brought on by antidepressants. This state lasted for about 20 more minutes before fading away completely."
1467,30409,"Upon consumption, the individual experienced immediate onset effects characterized by intense darkness and a distorted perception of their room. Objects appeared misplaced and rearranged in unfamiliar configurations. An entity was perceived as responsible for altering the room's layout, which the participant attempted to communicate with and control. The experience included vivid sensory perceptions such as tasting iced tea without physically consuming it. After an attempt to leave the altered environment, normalcy returned, allowing the individual to move about their house normally. They noted dilated pupils and promptly documented the experience."
1468,25153,"The participant experienced two distinct sessions with an unnamed substance. In the first session, after inhaling the substance twice, they felt a body buzz and a strange sensation moving up and down their body, which intensified into a split-body experience. The left side of their body felt like it was flying through a green forest with a breeze on their skin and surrounded by plants and animals, while the right side remained in the car, feeling the road beneath the tires. This dual perception lasted for about two minutes before returning to normalcy.

In the second session, after taking large hits immediately, they experienced complex fractal-like visuals that gradually simplified into the edges of objects in their environment. There was no internal dialogue or clear thoughts during either experience; instead, there was a sense of awe at the deconstruction and resolution of visual perception."
1469,7740,"The participant began their first experience under a tree with friends around 2 p.m. After inhaling the substance twice, they felt odd sensations in their arms that made them feel heavy or as if something was pulling them without direction. Shaking did not alleviate these feelings. The jaw soon joined the arms in experiencing similar sensations, making it difficult to talk. As the experience progressed, the participant became scared and stood up, but found themselves involuntarily drawn towards spots of light filtering through the tree's shade. Their body would jerk as they reached each spot of light, creating a dot-connecting effect. They were unable to move away from these areas until forced inside by friends. Inside, the participant felt hot before gradually calming down and regaining normal function in their arms and jaw."
1470,24447,"The user and their partner smoked a 10X extract of an unnamed hallucinogen in a dorm room. The user felt constricted and experienced euphoria before becoming incoherent and giggling uncontrollably. They fought the effects and returned to normal quickly. The girlfriend became extremely pale, shivered, and screamed that ""nothing belongs to her."" She calmed down after a few minutes. Both participants found the experience frightening due to its intensity and speed of onset."
1471,22187,"The individual experienced a series of unusual visual and auditory phenomena after consuming an unspecified substance. They first saw five indescribable objects moving towards them, with their thoughts being read aloud. Counter-thoughts generated by the individual caused replicas of these objects to appear behind each one in sequence. The term ""Din'"" was significant during this phase.

Next, they felt as though they were sitting at a dining table with family members on either side. A strong feeling of shame arose when they imagined themselves sitting atop the table instead. On the left edge of the table, two fingers emerged from beneath it, pulling the wood as if it were cloth. These fingers spoke in a distinct voice and created a sensation of being pulled towards them.

The experience then shifted to an unclear state with intermittent visions and feelings, though details are sparse. The individual recalls both corners of the dining room table holding some significance but cannot recall what occurred specifically at the right corner."
1472,21221,"Three individuals shared an experience using a substance consumed through smoking dried leaf via a water pipe. One participant reported mild euphoria likely due to inexperience with the consumption method. Another experienced visual symmetry, shifts in relative gravity, and saw colored squares forming into a cube structure around them. The third individual perceived a 'background' musical harmonic and visions of DNA formation, where each side appeared as giant walls reflecting photons that swirled symmetrically like a helix. This person also felt these images were memories from infancy or before birth."
1473,18256,"Two individuals consumed a substance together, leading them to perceive their environment in a significantly altered manner. The participants reported feeling as though they had separated themselves from the physical world and were observing it from an elevated perspective, akin to a fourth-dimensional viewpoint. In this state, they described everything around them as appearing flat and less complex compared to what they perceived as a more expansive dimension."
1474,18261,"The participant tried the substance on three successive nights, smoking 4 bowls on the first night, 2 bowls on the second night, and 6 bowls on the third night. Each session began with a tingling sensation in the head after the initial hit but did not produce any significant effects beyond mild giddiness. The user felt that the substance was ineffective and concluded it might be of poor quality based on similar experiences reported online."
1475,12217,"The participant entered a dream state where they perceived themselves as a young child who had fallen onto the road and gotten dirt in their eyes. A father figure helped them wipe away the dirt, which symbolically represented removing earthly reality. As the father withdrew his handkerchief, the Earthly reality disappeared, leaving only a dark stain on the cloth. The father then spoke to the participant about being careful not to let earth get into one's eyes, as it can cause one to lose contact with their true self and believe in an illusionary place.

The participant realized they had lived a whole life in this dream world, complete with familiar elements like cats and dogs. They felt that this experience was strange and that such things did not truly exist. Upon returning to reality, the participant found themselves back as a child in their father's arms, glad to be free from the illusionary Earth."
1476,6814,"The participant began by smoking what they believed to be a mind-altering substance using a large water bong containing three medium-sized leaves. After taking several hits, they felt transported into another dimension where the room appeared made of round objects with a rubber-like texture. They perceived other people in the room talking to them but could not understand their words, which caused some anxiety.

The participant attempted to walk to their bed and noticed that the TV was active, showing Jay Leno who seemed to be watching over them like a god. Upon lying down, they heard whispering voices offering assurance that everything would be okay. The experience concluded with the participant feeling awe at what they had undergone, describing it as profoundly mind-altering."
1477,6471,"The participant began experiencing visual effects after several hits from a one-hitter device. They initially saw small vortexes in the corners of their eyes which evolved into flashing circles. These circles transformed into various food-like shapes such as lettuce, moldy orange, and watermelon before reverting to simple flashing circles again. When opening their eyes, they observed vortex patterns on the ceiling and perceived branches that faded in and out of focus through partially open venetian blinds near a tree outside. The experience was accompanied by physical sensations including tingling and a slight erection."
1478,5628,"The participant smoked dried leaves and experienced auditory hallucinations of chirping noises followed by visual hallucinations of small creatures playing and laughing. They felt an unseen force guiding them to their bed, where they encountered a beautiful woman who took them into a crystal palace. The crystals in the palace were described as alive and growing around them. The participant then became aware of their body being manipulated on the bed, seeing it from above as if floating. This was followed by transforming into a long paper ribbon connected to other beings, feeling their presence. They observed the growth of crystals from a dark area, which they found deeply moving and peaceful."
1479,5980,"The participant experienced an abrupt transition into what they referred to as ""WONDERLAND,"" where their body felt cold and ghost-like. They reported that music played through headphones seemed to communicate directly with them, guiding and questioning their presence in this altered state. The experience was described as a condensed version of a full psychedelic trip, starting immediately at the peak intensity. The participant encountered an entity they referred to as ""MAGIC,"" which tested their spiritual strength before returning them to ordinary reality. The overall impression was one of overwhelming power and otherworldliness."
1480,5279,"The participant began by inhaling two long hits from a water bong filled with kiwi soda. After the second hit, they felt lifted upwards and experienced dizziness and off-balance movements while walking around. Lying down on their bed, they initially saw small fibers under what appeared to be a microscope, rich in various colors. This was followed by a vivid scene of a multicolored tarantula that dissolved into smaller spiders which then turned into swirling liquid patterns. The participant also observed palm trees and fire in beautiful, fluctuating colors. A sudden flash occurred, after which the participant drifted off to sleep."
1481,4634,"The participants consumed a tea made from Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and experienced mild nausea initially but then felt alertness and body sensations similar to those of LSD. Visual effects became noticeable after about an hour, characterized by enhanced vision and intricate patterns on closed eyelids. The experience was described as cleaner and more intellectual compared to LSD.

After consuming marijuana, the visual effects intensified. One participant reported seeing repeating pentagonal patterns with distorted images of their parents, which sometimes morphed into designs of words, patterns, and faces. This pattern would stretch infinitely in all directions. During this journey, the individual could open their eyes but found the real world equally distorted.

The experience was described as the most powerful hallucinogenic experience compared to other substances like LSD, shrooms, ketamine, MDMA, and DXM. The trip lasted for about 6-7 hours, with participants able to fall asleep around 2 AM."
1482,3524,"The participant began their experience by smoking an unknown substance through a pipe, taking two hits in quick succession. Upon exhaling the second hit, they immediately felt the effects set in. They noticed that their speech sounded odd and found themselves laughing at the perceived absurdity of their surroundings. Objects in the room appeared distorted visually. The individual stood up but felt dizzy and realized their vision was not accurately representing reality as they knew it. Lying back down, they continued to laugh at the experience.

The effects lasted approximately 10 minutes before wearing off, though there were mild aftereffects including enhanced visual perception that persisted for a short while afterward."
1483,3110,"The participant consumed dried leaves of an unspecified plant in their backyard while listening to music. They smoked three bowls of the substance, with noticeable effects starting from the third bowl. The effects included slurred speech and difficulty walking, lasting approximately 10-20 seconds. During this period, they thought internally about being altered but quickly returned to normal. A similar but shorter effect was experienced during the third bowl. Overall, the experience was described as a brief high, somewhat comparable to smoking marijuana or being drunk."
1484,4454,"The individual began their experience after smoking cannabis and then ingesting a substance. Initially, they felt stoned but soon noticed that the physical dimensions of their bedroom seemed to disappear or become enchanted. They turned off the lights and enjoyed a dim color show.

During this state, the participant perceived an evil presence facing them, which wanted to fight. The encounter was intense, with the individual throwing punches as if in a Jim Carrey movie scene (""I'm kicking my ass!!!""). This entity represented personal demons from recent years. Instead of fighting back physically, the person used different tactics, eventually managing to expel and shrink the presence down to nothing.

As the experience concluded, the physical world dissolved back into reality. The participant lit a candle and reflected on what had happened until they were only stoned. They felt empty but in a way that suggested readiness for something new or meaningful."
1485,2749,"The participant smoked a mixture of an unnamed substance with cannabis outdoors at night. After a few minutes, they felt slightly more paranoid than usual. They then experienced a sensation of a large swirling vortex or black hole approaching from behind them, which was out of their direct line of sight but always seemed to be just behind their eyes. This feeling persisted for some time and caused discomfort and paranoia. The participant's friend did not experience the same sensations and reported being in an unusually contemplative state instead."
1486,9903,"The participant experienced an out-of-body experience (OBE) after consuming a substance. They felt a tingle starting in their limbs before being forcefully pulled from their physical body through the back, moving through walls and down the block. An unseen force seemed to be pulling them further away. The participant became concerned about traveling too far as they feared their physical body might die if they went too far. They struggled to return to their body by fighting against the force that had initially pulled them out. Upon returning, they entered their body through the back and opened their eyes to see a friend who was present watching over them. The friend was laughing, which bothered the participant as they could not comprehend what had happened. There was a sensation of magnetism drawing them back in an eastern direction. The effort to turn around in their seat after returning was exhausting."
1487,117556,"The individual consumed the substance through a bong bowl at home with their brother. Within 30 seconds, they began sweating profusely and giggling. Their perception shifted, and they found themselves in an out-of-body state, observing themselves and their brother frozen on a blacklight poster in his room. They felt trapped inside this image and attempted to claw their way out, fearing potential permanent effects from the experience."
1488,114393,"The individual began the experience while preparing to put on trousers in low light conditions. They noticed visual distortions, perceiving entities behind surfaces they gazed upon. Auditory hallucinations included voices commenting on their actions, such as ""why is he taking so much"" and ""oh dear."" The person experienced difficulty with basic tasks due to disorientation and dysphoria. Putting on trousers became challenging as the garment appeared to have an infinite number of sides and surfaces. They struggled to distinguish left from right and had trouble putting shoes back on, attempting several times before succeeding. The duration of the experience was unclear, but they estimated it lasted around 10 minutes."
1489,33898,"The narrator and a friend consumed an unspecified substance. The narrator experienced intense effects almost immediately after inhalation. They felt disconnected from their body and mind, leading them to wander around the pool area. During this period, they engaged in unusual behaviors such as burning a plastic baggy for entertainment. After the peak of the experience, the narrator returned to find their friend still at the lounge chair, having had a good time."
1490,34035,"The participant smoked a large amount of leaves from a plant in a secluded area alone. They experienced intense physical effects including loss of motor function and uncontrollable laughter for approximately 6 minutes. During this time, they felt terrified and had the sensation of a huge fist slowly clenching over their body while being violently pulled somewhere unknown. After about 15 minutes, the intensity decreased, leaving behind a mild 'stoned' feeling."
1491,115457,"The individual inhaled an extract from a plant and immediately experienced intense physical reactions, including writhing backwards onto the bed due to proprioceptive delusion and kinaesthetic disturbances. They saw themselves becoming part of an infinite hippodrome filled with clowns, each limb outstretched and facing forward as they rotated continuously. The person felt this was a form of punishment for consuming the plant extract. After screaming ""FUCK OFF"" to escape this experience, they were able to walk around their room but remained slightly dissociated. They also experienced uncontrollable laughter for about five minutes."
1492,72570,"The participant smoked a portion of a vial and felt mild disorientation initially but then experienced stronger effects after another inhalation. They perceived something pulling their chest backward and saw subtle visual distortions resembling melted cheese folding inward. Lying down, they felt large bugs wriggling up their pant legs, which they recognized as likely hallucinations. The music being listened to sounded richer and more three-dimensional than usual. Overall, the experience lasted about 5-10 minutes and was peaceful and happy without any scary moments."
1493,12277,"The participant first tried regular leaves but only experienced mild muscle tension and sweating before feeling relaxed. Later, with 5x extract, they felt intense pressure pushing them onto the bed, originating from a light source through waves. They perceived voices in the background and felt the presence of a female spirit, which they believed to be the plant's spirit. The experience included visualizations and a sense of being in a game show."
1494,35662,"The participant reported feeling heavy-headed after consuming the substance. Upon inhaling a stronger dose, they were engulfed by white light and experienced time slowing down dramatically. They observed their hand movements in slow motion with visible trails and heard music playing note-by-note. The experience lasted approximately 5-10 minutes before gradually wearing off, allowing them to regain some control and awareness of their surroundings."
1495,73758,"The participant felt disconnected from reality and perceived themselves as part of an atom or molecule of their sofa. They experienced a force pulling them back into the sofa, accompanied by auditory hallucinations of female voices telling them they could not go back. The participant attempted to escape this sensation but gradually succeeded in doing so. Interestingly, the partner had a similar experience at around the same time."
1496,73874,"The participant had a previous mild experience with an unnamed plant extract but decided to try again after research. This time, they took a larger dose and experienced intense physical sensations, including a feeling of being pulled by a staple-like object along their right side. They then perceived their friends as having animal faces resembling wolves from the music video ""Talk Shows on Mute"" by Incubus. These entities communicated that everything was an illusion and that the participant's apartment was just a television set with cameras. This made the participant feel angry and scared, doubting the reality of their surroundings.

The trip lasted about 10 minutes but felt longer. The user experienced heightened sensitivity to minor annoyances and became depressed, feeling self-critical. They isolated themselves in their room for about two hours until falling asleep."
1497,105203,"The individual began their experience by taking two hits of an unknown substance from a bong at home. After the second hit, they immediately closed their eyes and experienced several vivid hallucinations. Initially, they felt as though they were hovering over a desert filled with peyote cacti. The scene then shifted to them entering a hole full of lizards and transforming into their 5-year-old self standing on an old porch. They saw through a tunnel of vines into the clubhouse where they once played and invited another person, C, inside while laughing uncontrollably like a child.

Simultaneously, the individual was also in a cave. After about nine minutes, as indicated by Hania, their attention shifted from the porch to seeing Hania's face as a skull. They felt heavy and struggled to stand up, eventually falling to the ground until the weight lifted off them."
1498,111486,"The participant smoked a substance from a bowl while sitting in a recliner chair at their childhood home. They were talking with their friend who was playing Mario Maker on the Wii U across from them on the couch. Initially, they felt a warm sensation throughout their body but maintained control over their thoughts despite this feeling. Their speech became slightly impaired, taking longer to respond, and they reported feeling more relaxed and at ease.

After a few moments, the participant returned to feeling normal, though the relaxed state lingered for several hours afterward. No significant hallucinations or interactions with entities were described during the experience."
1499,105303,"The participant sat on the bed after inhaling the substance, experiencing auditory hallucinations where they heard voices emanating from transparent fractal-shaped entities. These entities attempted to communicate with the participant, advising them not to do something until they could explain further. The participant also engaged in dialogue with their right eye, which seemed familiar and had its own life story.

The participant perceived objects as multiple copies of themselves, including their cat who was sitting on a pillow. They noted that the cat always ignored them during these experiences but followed them into the bedroom when they smoked the substance. The participant then noticed something familiar out of their left eye, which turned out to be their right eye itself.

The experience included visual hallucinations where the participant's vision seemed to zip around the periphery as if their mind was being stuffed back into place. They engaged in dialogue with what they referred to as ""the cast and crew,"" questioning them about the nature of their experiences. The entities responded by suggesting that the participant take action rather than seeking help from them.

The participant also interacted with the Laura Ashley wallpaper, finding it aesthetically pleasing. They experienced a shift in emotions, moving from confusion to anger, before realizing they were not actually depressed but engaged in conversation with their environment. At the end of the experience, the participant's girlfriend entered the room and commented on smoking around the cat, which the participant disputed."
1500,113898,"The individual began their experience in a comfortable room, having recently meditated. After inhaling the substance, they quickly left their body and entered an alternate dimension. There, they encountered a being that appeared hostile towards them, making the participant feel as if they were in danger of being killed. To return to reality, the person focused on elements from their personal world. The experience was described as terrifying despite having set up a suitable environment beforehand."
1501,94899,"Four friends went to a secluded spot near a stream and trees for their activity. Each took turns inhaling smoke from a bong containing an extract. Initially, there was mild euphoria with giggling, which escalated over about a minute until reaching a peak. During this climax, the surroundings seemed to fade out, and the participant experienced uncontrollable laughter and physical movements like kicking and waving. The stream noises intensified. After the peak, consciousness returned gradually, and the world reappeared in a more retrospective manner. The effects lasted around 20 minutes before fully wearing off. Post-trip, the bong water was consumed by one of the participants, who found it unpleasant but not psychoactive."
1502,43661,"The individual experienced immediate sensory alterations after inhaling the substance. They closed their eyes and began to visualize, losing control over these visualizations. A woman appeared in their mind, identified as a former preschool teacher, who communicated concerns about relationship issues and personal functioning. The participant felt an urge to cry but then laughed due to the perceived supportive nature of this interaction.

Opening their eyes, they noticed that time had passed without them reacting, prompting concern from their friend. Subsequent experiences included a lack of sense of time, frequent laughter, and minor hallucinations such as seeing what appeared to be a ghost out of the corner of their eye. The friend attempted to provoke a reaction by growling and momentarily appearing with fangs."
1503,17053,"The individual smoked an unknown substance using a small pipe in their bathroom while alone in the house except for their sleeping girlfriend. They initially consumed several doses without feeling any effects before taking one final deep inhalation which immediately produced intense effects. 

They felt as though every cell in their body had doubled in weight and lost all balance, staggering into their bedroom where they laid down in darkness. The experience included intense visual hallucinations of colors and light that were not present in reality. Their body felt like it was falling and twisting rapidly.

The trip lasted about 15 minutes before ending abruptly. Since then, the individual has used this substance multiple times with no bad trips reported, recommending an extract form but noting it should not be used daily."
1504,65687,"The individual inhaled an unknown substance through a pipe, turned off the lights, and lay down. Initially feeling nothing, they soon experienced a strong buzzing sensation and lost consciousness for several minutes. Upon regaining awareness, they were unsure of what had transpired during their unconscious state. This has occurred twice previously."
1505,73920,"The participant experienced a highly immersive hallucination where reality appeared pixelated and fractalized. They felt as though they melted into the environment, becoming one with it. Visuals blurred and smeared together, creating a sense of dissolution between objects. Sounds were disconnected from their sources, adding to the disorienting experience. The participant stood still, observing everything and nothing happening simultaneously. This state lasted for less than an hour."
1506,84186,"The participant sat in their friend's room and consumed a significant amount of an unknown substance. They felt a ripple effect through their body after inhaling it. The room appeared to change like flipping pages in a book, suggesting a shift into a different reality. The participant believed they could control this transition between realities.

They climbed what seemed to be the form of a large being and were eventually pushed onto the bed by their friend. During the experience, the participant walked towards a wall, stood in a cardboard box trash can, and tore down a poster."
1507,93756,"The participant had two experiences with an unknown substance. In the first experience, they smoked small doses of the substance without any additional substances. This resulted in mild effects characterized by a hazy and cozy feeling but no hallucinations. The second experience involved combining the substance with nitrous oxide. This combination produced a stronger effect where the participant felt their hands were far away from their body and experienced a stark, grave mental state. They alternated between smoking the substance and inhaling nitrous oxide for approximately 40-45 minutes, sustaining an altered state of consciousness without hallucinations."
1508,91247,"The participant met an entity named Mystery after taking a substance. Mystery appeared as a human-like figure with green light emanating from her body. She laughed at the participant's intoxicated state and then dissolved into the walls, causing the room to change dimensionally. The participant felt suffocated and experienced a sense of death before being resurrected."
1509,11150,"The participant first tried the substance at a friend's house with two other people. After inhaling a small dose, they experienced a sensation of being pulled in an indeterminate direction, as if riding in a car. This was accompanied by visual distortions where it seemed like the room was moving. The user felt unbalanced and strange after the effects wore off.

The friend also reported feeling a pull but described it as backwards, while the girlfriend found the experience uncomfortable, experiencing temperature fluctuations and describing her skin as rubbery. She returned to normal in about five minutes, though she remained uneasy.

Later that night, the participant tried again alone with a larger dose. They experienced visual distortions where their field of vision seemed to turn right, and they felt a pull trying to rotate it. The room appeared rounded like part of a cylinder. A black light falling from the ceiling was perceived as if coming out of the girlfriend's body.

The girlfriend later tried again in darkness with a candle. She reported moving down an angled wall, seeing a house, and feeling surrounded by family. When she opened her eyes, she could see two parts of the room at opposite angles simultaneously.

In another session, the participant experienced visual patterns spreading over blackness while their eyes were closed, as well as pressure sensations from these patterns even when they moved away."
1510,11230,"The participant began by smoking multiple bowls of an unknown substance. After the third bowl, they experienced visual distortions including a glowing, ropey pattern that permeated their field of vision. This was followed by the room dividing into a grid and everything slipping towards a central point (0,0,0). Two thoughts appeared as entities: the First Thought, which dared the participant to smoke another bowl, and the Other Thought, who did not express sentiment but seemed supportive.

The First Thought manifested as a male figure sliding up the right edge of the vision cone, smiling mischievously and poking at the participant. The Other Thought wore a Columbo-like hat and trenchcoat, supporting the left side of the vision cone. Both entities communicated that the participant's friends could not join them in this experience.

The participant attempted to communicate with the First Thought but realized words were insufficient. As the First Thought approached, the field of vision unraveled, returning to a more normal state. The entire experience lasted approximately 1-2 minutes."
1511,11040,"Mike experienced intense hallucinations after taking an unspecified substance. During the experience, he became disoriented and confused, crawling around on the ground and nearly breaking a fish tank. He was unable to communicate effectively with others present, staring at them with a panicked and confused expression. It took about 4 minutes for Mike to start coming back to his normal state of mind. After fully returning, he expressed surprise at the strength of the experience and thanked the person who administered it.

The trip was so intense that five out of eight people in attendance became frightened and hid in a bedroom, thinking they might need to call the police due to Mike's behavior. The substance is described as requiring specific administration techniques for optimal effects, including deep inhalation through a water bong for 21 seconds. It is noted that the experience can significantly alter one's perception of reality."
1512,10955,"The participant sat on the couch and inhaled the substance. Initially, there was no immediate effect but it gradually set in. As the effects came on, the participant's heartbeat became very pronounced. The participant felt dissociated from their body, warm, and comfortable. After about five minutes, the experience began to subside."
1513,107977,"The individual inhaled smoke from an unknown substance using a pipe filled with water. They immediately felt as if they were pulled backward through a tunnel, experiencing weightlessness similar to a roller coaster. During this experience, they saw pairs of eyes of various colors watching them fall. Upon reaching a new state of consciousness, the participant was unsure whether their body or the truck seat was themselves and found it difficult to move their limbs. They felt thirsty and managed to drink water from a cup, but perceived the water as dry going down their throat. The experience left them feeling disoriented with everything appearing tilted at an angle for about 15 minutes."
1514,88386,"At 9:54 pm, the participant inhaled a small amount of an unknown substance and held their breath for about 45 seconds before exhaling. Upon exhalation, they experienced altered perceptions of reality where everything appeared to be moving in slow motion and repeating itself for several seconds at a time. They also heard what sounded like family members yelling at them.

The effects began to wear off around 10:00 pm, but the participant felt confused and disoriented, unable to locate their belongings or find their way around their own house. By 10:20 pm, most of the effects had subsided, leaving only a lingering confusion."
1515,24021,"The participant experienced visual phenomena including seeing into other rooms and observing scenes from summer days with tiled surfaces. They encountered imagery of Mayan art and felt a sense of transformation, as if turning inside out to become the spaces others inhabit. The experience included perceptions of interconnectedness and shared patterns forming an illusion of reality."
1516,98304,"The experience began in a friend's apartment while smoking a substance. The participant immediately lost touch with reality as they exhaled. They felt a line of energy form from the center of their body to the crotch, dividing their perception into two sides: one side remained connected to the physical world, while the other half was halfway out of a vast white wall. On this side, thousands of unfamiliar faces cheered and clapped enthusiastically.

The crowd informed the participant that they were ""finished"" and explained that life is a simulation, with the current state being the real reality. The participant expressed discomfort with this experience and attempted to shift the line of energy back towards their physical body by moving it as far left as possible. Once the energy reached the tip of their finger, the trip ended."
1517,16847,"The participant consumed an unknown substance in four increasing doses. After each dose, they experienced slight tingling sensations and pressure moving around their body. The fourth dose produced the strongest effects. Visually, the room appeared to stretch and move towards them, then backwards, down, and up, particularly at the corners of their field of vision. This experience was likened to a combination of nitrous oxide, cannabis, and an acid trip. They emphasized the importance of using a sitter for inexperienced users and recommended not standing during the effects."
1518,95662,"The individual experienced several distinct realities during their trip. The first two were somewhat familiar but became increasingly bizarre as the trip progressed. In reality five, the most intense state, they perceived colors that seemed unprecedented. Throughout the experience, the participant laughed hysterically and drooled."
1519,46616,"The first experience described occurred in a group setting outside where the user smoked from a bong. After inhaling deeply, the user felt like time had frozen around them, creating a sense of isolation. They attempted to return to their previous state but ended up moving to another seat as the effects began to wane.

In subsequent solo experiences at home, the substance helped release feelings towards the user's father and made the user feel partially like an insect. The next day, while riding a motorcycle, the user felt anger towards an ex-colleague dissipate suddenly.

Another experience involved losing keys and finding them later, which was interpreted as the substance being with the user even after the effects had worn off."
1520,57251,"The participant consumed a substance using a water bong before going out for Halloween. After inhaling, they briefly passed out and then entered a dream-like state where movement was difficult and speech was unclear. They experienced a visual of an energy field approaching at a 45-degree angle which caused fear. The individual attempted to escape the experience by closing their eyes but the sensation returned. When the energy field reached them, it produced a crawling skin feeling described as ""flushed."" Overwhelmed with fear and believing they might die, the participant sought comfort from their brother, holding onto him tightly to avoid being alone."
1521,108670,"The participant smoked the substance and experienced an immediate onset of effects, feeling as if they were transported into another world. In this altered state, they perceived themselves as part of a larger entity resembling a dragon's hide, with other humans packed on top of each other. They managed to twist their body around and saw the sky transform back into the room. A luminous figure in a pink robe appeared on the TV screen, speaking reassuringly before the participant returned to their room. The experience lasted several minutes but felt much longer. Upon returning to reality, they were covered in sweat and initially disoriented but eventually felt calm and relaxed."
1522,68529,"The individual began by drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco before consuming an unspecified substance. After taking one hit from a pipe, they experienced intense visual distortions. They could see three layers of reality simultaneously, with people's faces appearing differently depending on their movement. The friend Sara appeared to be glowing green and slightly disintegrated, while the brother was perceived as an enormous pillar extending upwards and downwards. The brother's voice echoed loudly but was incomprehensible.

The participant felt a burning sensation in specific areas of their body, including the back of thighs, arms, chest, and neck, as if being snapped with a rubber band. This pain persisted for 15 minutes after the initial effects began to wane. They also experienced an intense feeling that they might not return from this state due to its intensity.

After attempting to get up, they felt a force pushing them back onto the bed. The burning sensation continued even as the main effects subsided, lasting almost an hour. The individual concluded that the experience revealed multiple layers of reality and how these are composed of many pieces, suggesting a chaotic nature without order."
1523,73622,"During the trip, the participant experienced several stages of their life, encountering individuals from childhood through adulthood, including friends and family members. These entities questioned the authenticity of the participant's experiences, suggesting that everything might not be real. The encounter with these entities was unsettling, causing the participant to feel as though they were part of a test or simulation. Upon returning to normal consciousness, the individual felt confused and considered suicide due to the profound impact of the experience."
1524,58753,"The individual consumed an unspecified substance and immediately felt difficulty moving after inhaling it, sliding out of their chair and falling onto the floor. They experienced visualizations of friends' faces and a sensation of electric vibration throughout their body. Philosophically, they thought about telepathic brain connections replacing verbal communication and imagined that life was ending but also beginning anew.

Despite feeling immobilized at first, the individual managed to get up and ran outside, throwing open the back gate where they usually kept their puppy confined. They believed everyone, including animals, would join them in running towards a park to meet Jesus. However, upon looking around, they noticed no one else was joining them and almost jumped in front of a motorcyclist to ask why he wasn't participating.

The individual eventually realized the world remained normal and returned home feeling exhausted."
1525,110075,"The participant experienced visual distortions after inhaling an unknown substance. The room's corners appeared connected to the television screen, and their arm was adorned with Christmas lights attached to the ceiling. While watching a film, characters were perceived as wearing white suits against a white background. Physical sensations included limbs feeling like bananas. They sought help from their girlfriend, who woke up and asked what they had taken."
1526,112260,"The experience began with a sense of disconnection from surroundings and feelings. The participant felt consumed by gyrating machinery before transitioning into a dreamlike state where they perceived themselves as a minecart rolling through an exaggerated, cartoonish world. This environment was described as satirically comical and the participant reported feeling a pleasant, whole sensation throughout.

During this experience, the sky cracked open, and the participant felt pulled into it. They briefly saw their roommate but were unaware of having spilled a bong on themselves or attempting to stand up before falling onto a coffee table. The participant experienced what they described as 'ego death,' questioning whether they were dead and quickly accepting this possibility without fear, though with some confusion.

The overall experience was characterized by calmness and relaxation, culminating in an enjoyable, albeit brief, ride as a minecart."
1527,25642,"The participant consumed an unspecified substance multiple times over several hours. Initially ingesting the substance from capsules, they then smoked it with a small amount of cannabis added. Each attempt resulted in a mild, mellow buzz without significant visual hallucinations or intense effects. The experience was characterized by slowed perception and feelings of tiredness. This led to sleep during the day and again later that evening. No adverse side effects were reported beyond drowsiness."
1528,82788,"The individual reported experiencing intense hallucinations after consuming the substance. During this period, they wandered through an empty house searching for characters from a book they had been reading, despite these characters not being present in reality. They laughed uncontrollably throughout their disoriented state and felt confused and out of control. The experience lasted approximately fifteen minutes."
1529,90254,"The participant reported entering a state characterized by visual hallucinations of swirling yellow patterns with white circles containing black lines arranged in a circular formation that then intersected in an X shape. This was followed by a ""zipper effect"" experience, where they felt as if moving through space enclosed within a cloak-like structure, zipping forward at high speed. The sensation was described as similar to being on a train ride but with the participant feeling like the train itself. Accompanying this were auditory sensations reminiscent of a Pixar movie soundtrack. Towards the end of the experience, there was a sense of jumping from place to place, likened to a spring."
1530,52934,"The participant first mixed an unknown substance with marijuana but did not feel significant effects. On a second occasion, they smoked the substance alone in a higher dose. Within 10 seconds of inhalation, they felt reality slipping away and experienced being pulled to the right while their visual field remained stationary. They then perceived the room tearing in half, believing it was real for a brief moment before returning to normalcy after about two minutes. The experience concluded with a calm state similar to smoking marijuana."
1531,17896,"The participant reported experiencing a series of physical sensations following the use of an unspecified substance. These included tingling throughout the body and waves of hot flashes. Suddenly, they felt aggressive and hostile as if a wild animal was trying to emerge. They began growling loudly, grinding their teeth, biting at the air, and using their hands in claw-like motions. The mind entered an ""attack mode."" This state lasted for approximately five to seven minutes before subsiding."
1532,44322,"The user and their friend inhaled an unspecified substance from a pipe, equivalent to about 0.3 grams. After inhaling, the user experienced physical sensations including pressure on the face followed by a rush-like feeling that traveled down the body. Both individuals found everything around them extremely amusing and laughed for what seemed like an extended period of time. The experience felt very intense but did not produce hallucinations for either participant."
1533,72319,"The participant consumed an unspecified amount of an extract from a plant, likely for its psychoactive effects. After inhaling the substance, they reclined and experienced a vivid journey. During this journey, they encountered what they described as an ""amazing being"" that showed them aspects of life they had never felt before. The encounter left the participant feeling positive about their future and believing everything to be perfect."
1534,53012,"The individual reported feeling as though everything around them was melting into nothingness, leading to a sensation of falling asleep. Upon waking up, they found themselves in what they perceived as a different reality or dimension. In this new existence, the participant encountered an entity that communicated with them about the nature of their previous life and existence, suggesting it wasn't real.

The experience in the 'real' existence felt extremely long, almost infinite to the participant. After some time there, the individual suddenly returned to what they considered the ""real"" world, feeling confused about which reality was truly real."
1535,66253,"The individual began with minimal effects from ingesting a large cup of brew. They then smoked marijuana, experiencing mild euphoria and enhanced colors while talking with friends. Later, they smoked Salvia extract in a large dose, leading to an intense trip lasting over an hour. During this time, the scene around them appeared cartoonish and unreal, and there was a sense that their friends were merely thoughts in their head. The individual also experienced a brief period of ego loss but regained consciousness quickly."
1536,67317,"The participant woke up at 3 AM feeling exhausted and emotionally sensitive. They smoked a joint to calm down and later attended a hockey game where they were moderately intoxicated. After the game, they went to another location to smoke salvia. During this process, the group experienced some difficulties with transportation due to ice and snow. The participant tried snowboarding down icy stairs but failed.

When smoking salvia, the first two participants did not feel its effects strongly. The third participant took multiple hits of a mixture of salvia and weed, leading to an intense trip characterized by disorientation and difficulty standing upright. They also experienced visual hallucinations of naked women and felt confused about their sexual orientation during this time.

The peak experience was very intense for the main participant but not as much for the others. After about 10 minutes, the effects began to subside, and they returned home feeling relieved."
1537,22181,"While in their room, the participant experienced visual and auditory hallucinations after consuming an unidentified substance through a homemade bong. They initially saw a guard rail and their war hammer models cheering for them, feeling shocked but also proud and confident. After another hit, they commanded their brother to turn off the lights, creating an eerie gloom in the room. The brother then transformed into a goblin-like entity (resembling Golum from Lord of the Rings) which frightened the participant.

The participant moved under a blanket, experiencing sensations as if someone was jumping on the side of the bed. They believed they were in Africa and felt sick. Their daughter and wife appeared by their side during this time. The brother eventually woke them up, after which the participant left to write the report."
1538,10938,"The individual began their journey in a state of depression after watching a movie about political issues. They ventured outside into near darkness and consumed dried leaves through a pipe. Immediately, they experienced intense visual distortions where everything seemed to melt away.

This experience was likened to exploring outer space and tasting the edge of the universe for a brief moment."
1539,111326,"The participant consumed a significant amount of an unknown substance over a period of half an hour but experienced only mild effects. They felt slightly relaxed and observed minor visual disturbances, such as flickering light out of the corner of their eye. No interactions with other entities were reported during this experience."
1540,74250,"The participant and several friends took an unknown substance. The participant experienced a brief period of confusion and a distorted sense of time, feeling it lasted about 10 seconds although it was actually around three minutes. Their girlfriend had a bad experience with pain throughout her body. Two other friends felt a connection to nature but did not report anything particularly noteworthy.

1541,40921,"The participant consumed an unknown substance using a jet lighter and experienced a brief altered state of consciousness lasting about 3 minutes. During this time, they perceived themselves and their friend sitting on a couch but felt as if they were observing from outside their bodies while also being inside their own body. The experience was described as strange rather than frightening."
1542,67224,"Walter consumed a significant amount of green smoke from a bong and experienced intense effects. Initially, he laughed uncontrollably and alternated between smiling and dropping his head down motionless. He then fell off his chair onto the floor and attempted to bite Logan's finger before lying on the ground, showing signs of losing touch with reality.

Walter asked if anyone was calling him, expressing confusion when told it was just Logan. He mumbled and scurried around on the floor, attempting to bite Logan again before seeming to come out of it briefly. However, he suddenly stood up and bolted out of the room, yelling and screaming in the kitchen.

Walter eventually calmed down after being reassured that the effects would last only a few more minutes. He described his experience as seeing the universe as pictures in a book with everyone disappearing except for hundreds of Logans who also disappeared. He felt he was trying to hold up the cover of the book from closing, which he later realized was Logan's leg."
1543,71656,"The participant took their first dose of an unspecified substance with a high dosage. Upon inhalation, they felt a slight buzz that quickly intensified, leading to a state of complete disconnection from themselves and reality. During this altered state, they perceived themselves as an object, similar to a chair with a person in it, among many identical objects in what seemed like a ""matrix."" This perception was accompanied by recurring fear, as the participant believed their real life had been an illusion and that this new state represented actual reality. The experience was described as overwhelming and potentially life-changing."
1544,55739,"The participant smoked an unknown substance with a friend in June. They had previously tried this substance before and found it to be weak.

They experienced vivid visual effects, seeing colors of the rainbow moving around. The participant also laughed intensely throughout the experience."
1545,87246,"During the experience, the individual perceived that time had dramatically slowed down, with an hour seeming to pass for them while only five minutes elapsed according to others.

The participant also experienced thoughts about reality not being real."
1546,70220,"The participant experienced an unpleasant physical sensation described as skin-crawling pain during the trip. They also felt a brief warm feeling internally. Visually, they perceived pinkish red 'Y' shapes interspersed with round dark circular objects in their field of vision. The experience was predominantly uncomfortable and differed from others who found it pleasurable."
1547,40043,"The participant experienced their first use of a substance alone, starting with a small dose that had no noticeable effects. They increased the dosage until reaching approximately 150 mg, at which point they felt their head become heavy and their room transform into an environment with olive trees and a sandy road. The user reported feeling extremely happy and laughed loudly.

After returning to reality, the participant tried again with a slightly larger dose. This time, their room appeared to melt like a Salvador Dali painting and transformed into what seemed like a beach with trees. The water in this new environment was perceived as being on a different layer than the ground, attempting to cover the user. The experience brought about intense feelings of happiness, leading the participant to believe they might be in paradise."
1548,55769,"Upon administration of the substance, the participant experienced a pulling sensation primarily in their legs, as if something was tugging on them. They also felt the presence of an entity that they perceived as female. The individual attempted to communicate with this entity but found it challenging due to lingering effects from the experience."
1549,72469,"The participant took an unspecified dose of an extract from a psychoactive plant and began experiencing altered perceptions almost immediately. They reported feeling as though their brain had entered a dream-like state, where they were aware that reality was being experienced as if in a dream. The individual perceived someone to be present in the kitchen despite knowing no one was there. This sensation was accompanied by an awareness of being on the other side of a mirror, with the understanding that they were in a replica of the real world but unable to return to normal consciousness. During this experience, even minor details felt extraordinary and enjoyable."
1550,47076,"The participant took two large doses of an unknown substance and began experiencing intense effects shortly after. While riding a bicycle, they felt their mind folding and twisting inwards, revealing all its contents. This visual effect was accompanied by uncontrollable laughter. The high peaked quickly but was described as comparable to the peak experience of ten LSD strips."
1551,54242,"The participant consumed an unknown substance with friends in a dimly lit room. After taking a large dose, the individual experienced visual distortions, seeing multiple screens simultaneously. They lost control over their body and felt as if they were transported to another place, forgetting about the original room and people present.

The entire experience lasted approximately 15 minutes."

1554,79571,"The participant reports consuming an unknown substance while watching pornographic videos. Upon consumption, they feel as though they are inside the video, experiencing everything as if it were real. They perceive the women in the videos as speaking to them directly and engaging with them personally. This leads to a strong belief that these interactions are genuine, even though the participant acknowledges this is not actually the case after the effects wear off.

The most intense experiences occur when the substance is consumed midway through self-stimulation, enhancing the feeling of being part of the video. As they approach climax, another dose intensifies their sensations further, creating a highly immersive and pleasurable experience."
1555,81528,"The participant began laughing uncontrollably before experiencing an altered state where they perceived a different reality. In this new environment, their friend was incorporated into an endless, colorful wall that could change direction. The participant felt a strong pull towards the wall but resisted entering it due to fear of never returning to the real world. There was an antagonistic feel associated with the wall. As the experience progressed, the participant's physical movement became impaired and they felt weighted down.

Approximately 20 seconds after exhaling, they experienced tingling in their hands and legs, followed by visual disturbances including spinning images behind closed eyes. As the experience progressed, the individual reported seeing various colors, particularly red, orange, and yellow.

1557,64092,"The participant inhaled smoke from a water-cooled bong and experienced almost instantaneous effects. They began to giggle uncontrollably and felt as though their legs had a mind of their own.

After about one minute, the effects wore off suddenly, leaving them standing with their fingers down their throat, attempting to understand why."
1558,61259,"The participant experienced their first use of an unnamed substance by smoking it in a water pipe. After consuming half of a second dose, they were suddenly pulled to the ground on their left-hand side and felt as though they were an arrow on a spinning board, only able to move by spinning around. This sensation became uncomfortable due to wearing jeans. The experience was initially perceived as normal. Upon returning to their usual state, the participant noticed a significant improvement in eyesight, which lasted for about 20 minutes."
1559,95052,"The participant smoked a substance and immediately felt a strong onset of effects. They reported being trapped in what they described as infinity, unable to perceive the outside world clearly. Their friend was present and attempted to communicate with them but the participant could not fully hear or understand their words. The experience was intense and disorienting."
1560,58038,"The participant inhaled smoke from an extract and immediately felt the room flip, experiencing visual distortions and a sensation of falling. Friends in front of them appeared to have their legs flying towards the participant's face, causing distress until it stopped abruptly.

Following this, the participant experienced a body high similar to cannabis use that lasted approximately 45 minutes."

They reported feeling as though their head opened up like a funnel and two sticks were inserted into either side, causing them to rotate horizontally in circles for about five minutes. During this time, they rolled around on the bed repeatedly.

A male friend (B) was present and observed the participant laughing hysterically and moving in circular motions. After approximately five minutes, the participant expressed fear and requested reality. B responded by grabbing their hands and looking them in the face to calm them down. The experience ended with the participant feeling it had been a nice one overall, despite a brief period of fear."
1562,73068,"The participant inhaled a mixture of Salvia leaf and 5X salvia through a joint, taking about four inhalations while keeping the match lit during inhalation.

1563,101094,"The participant smoked the substance five times using a pipe for the second time. Initially, there was no effect, but then subtle sensations began. Closing their eyes, they felt their hands entering a yellow light within a yellow box.

The experience included the sensation of being in three different places (or universes) simultaneously and a profound sense of completeness."
1564,86837,"The participant began their experience by smoking from a water pipe while listening to new age music. After approximately 60 seconds, they opened their eyes and found themselves in an altered visual state where the floor appeared to be absent, replaced by a black abyss. In this setting, a hallucinated entity resembling a sweaty, pudgy clown child was observed directly below them, mirroring the participant's position. The music changed to a childlike style reminiscent of Barney the Dino."
1565,55950,"The participant experienced two sessions of a substance. During the first session, they smoked the substance outside with a friend. After taking one hit each, the participant began to fall over and saw multiple people laughing at them, though there was only one friend present. They fell onto the house and laughed uncontrollably until the effects subsided.

In the second session, conducted indoors, the participant took two hits and started running inside but then fell down the stairs while laughing uncontrollably. During this fall, they perceived kitchen cupboards falling off the wall simultaneously. The effects ended quickly in both sessions."
1566,49532,"The participant smoked an unnamed substance while at a friend's house. Within 30 seconds, they experienced numbness starting from their legs as they were lying down. They then blacked out for about 15 seconds before regaining consciousness. Upon waking up, the participant felt that their body was in a grid-like structure and had a fear of splitting apart if they moved too much. This led to them slowly moving and observing their body seemingly split and fall apart, which they found amazing. During this experience, they heard Nintendo music playing in their head, causing them to laugh uncontrollably. The participant eventually returned to reality and expressed amazement at the experience."
1567,87356,"The participant experienced intense visual disturbances after inhaling an unknown substance. Their vision began to shake, and they felt detached from their surroundings, with people appearing distant. They saw rapidly changing images as if flipping through pages or watching a vintage film. The individual found it difficult to move and laughed uncontrollably despite trying to stop. There was a brief moment of panic but it subsided as the experience progressed."
1568,61981,"The participant was sitting in a chair with two friends when they consumed the substance. Initially, there were no effects after inhaling a small amount, but consuming a larger dose led to immediate physical sensations including lightheadedness similar to smoking marijuana. The room then turned black as if being zipped up like a body bag. Two people, a man and a woman, approached the participant during this experience. The trip lasted approximately three minutes, during which time the participant reportedly screamed loudly but did not remember doing so afterwards."
1569,64191,"The participant reports experiencing two entities during their trip: one male and closer to them, and another female who appears to be guiding or compelling both entities to do something.

1570,107978,"The individual was sitting outside when they began to feel the effects of the substance. They experienced a sudden sensation of falling backward into a casket, buried under red clay soil. Above them, a funeral procession took place as if it were their own funeral. People came to say goodbye and leave flowers."
1571,38481,"The participant experienced a sudden onset of intense sensations after inhaling the substance. They reported feeling as though everything rushed away from them and their vision became hazy and chaotic. The participant felt terrified and called out for help twice but received no response from their trip sitter. The peak effects lasted approximately 5 minutes, followed by a gradual return to normalcy over about 30 minutes."

1573,61475,"The participant attended a social gathering with several people near their school where most individuals were smoking pot. An acquaintance offered them a substance through a pipe after being given 4 hits. The effects began shortly after, causing dizziness and altering behavior in a way similar to when they are stoned. This state lasted for approximately 1-2 hours during which the participant experienced typical marijuana-like symptoms such as feeling light-headed and having the munchies."
1574,82517,"The participant reported using a substance at different doses multiple times. At lower doses (5x and 10x), no significant effects were observed beyond feeling high. However, at a higher dose (20x), the individual experienced an intense trip three times. During these trips, the person felt as though they were trying to escape but found that each attempt created a new reality where the struggle continued. The experience included perceptions of dissolving into objects or becoming parts of them, such as the tip of a French fry or a lawnmower blade. Reality was perceived as shifting rapidly and unpredictably, similar to flipping through pages in a book."
1575,46932,"The narrator and their friends obtained a substance from a smoke shop and consumed it over several days.

They observed their friends hallucinating and tripping out on smaller doses than what the narrator consumed."
1576,46551,"The participant consumed an unspecified substance in a homemade bong with a butane lighter. They took about six hits and held them for around 30 seconds each. At the peak of the experience, they felt a slight increase in body weight and noticed their face drooping slightly. There was also a sensation that the car they were in was moving, though this may have been an illusion. When closing their eyes, they saw mild colors but attributed this to the lack of oxygen from holding their breath during the hits. The overall experience was described as disappointing with minimal effects."
1577,65716,"The participant sat down to consume an unknown substance and inhaled it twice. After the second inhalation, they felt their body become liquid-like, sinking into the pavement. Time and space seemed to disappear, and the trees and insects began communicating with them. The participant experienced heightened sensory perception, feeling a sharpness in sight, sound, and touch while remaining calm. They laid down in the grass for some time."
1578,67889,"The participant took two hits from a small bong and held each for approximately 10 and 24 seconds respectively. They were listening to music when they noticed a propeller-like structure made of hands throwing fragments of the music at them, despite their monitor being off. Frustration and itchiness led them to sit down, after which a face composed of fragmented music appeared and smiled at them in an unpleasant manner. The participant then closed their eyes and saw colors until the effects subsided."
1579,76942,"The participant consumed half a gram of an unspecified substance through smoking with a water pipe after meditating and asking for guidance from a divine essence.

Additionally, their name was spoken once at the beginning of the experience and continued to be heard throughout until the end."
1580,53859,"The narrator was at a lakehouse with three friends who had consumed the substance. After observing their reactions, he decided to try it himself. He took two hits and began to feel unusual sensations. Initially, he felt wet and uncomfortable in his pants, which he perceived as a scary tunnel. His legs buckled when he tried to stand up, causing him to fall to the floor. He eventually put his pants back on and went to sleep."
1581,34345,"The participants smoked an unknown substance in a park's wooded area. After the second dose, the individual felt tingling and prickling sensations starting from their ankles. They perceived the trees as alive with animal calls emerging from within the woods. Their voice changed, and they laughed uncontrollably for no apparent reason.

As the effects peaked after about ten minutes, the participant experienced visual distortions such as moving walls, spinning bright colors, and rotating symmetrical figures. The experience felt longer than it actually was, lasting only five minutes but seeming like hours. The friend could not recall all that happened during this period."
1582,56964,"The participant and two friends traveled to Longview, TX, after an unnamed substance became illegal in Louisiana. They purchased the substance from a store and smoked it in a crowded parking lot. After taking a large dose, the participant experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. The first thing they noticed was a musical scene felt mentally rather than seen or heard. The friends appeared as foam-like objects and communicated that the participant was too early for something significant.

The participant then saw a rainbow-like object that was flat but contained all colors imaginable. They grabbed it, believing it to be important. During this experience, they also noticed familiar elements from their surroundings, such as parts of the warehouse parking lot where they were located. The participant felt like they had become part of a dream and experienced a sense of not being fully present in reality."
1583,45056,"The individual began experiencing effects after inhaling a small amount of a substance. Initially, they felt disoriented but then noticed their vision seemed to be closing in as if the upper and lower halves were coming together like pages of a book nearly shutting. This led to panic, causing them to express concern about continuing and even attempt to grab the steering wheel while being driven by a friend. The surroundings remained confusing despite some awareness. They felt pulled out of their usual perception but did not fully hallucinate. The trip was unpleasant, and they recognized the danger of using substances while driving."
1584,36483,"The participant consumed an unknown substance with their step brother. After the first hit, the participant experienced a brief period of disorientation and perceived changes in body structure, feeling as though their right arm was attached to their jaw and both were connected to a pillar-like structure running diagonally through their body. The second hit intensified these effects but did not significantly alter reality perception. During this phase, the participant felt they had become a plate inside a dishwasher and attempted to convince someone to help them move over a row.

The third hit led to a more profound altered state lasting two or three minutes. In this state, the participant perceived themselves as part of a pattern on a rug in the living room, experiencing sensations of rolling and flapping. They also had a perspective from which they could observe their step brother on an adjacent couch. Throughout these experiences, there were moments of hysterical laughter, confusion, and silliness."
1585,55916,"The participant began their drug experience at 10:22 AM in a clean room with minimal distractions. They smoked salvia extract using a homemade water bong while listening to music. Initially, the participant was nervous but decided to proceed after taking one large hit and holding it for about 20 seconds.

After some time, the participant felt safe and comfortable, experiencing visual changes that made everything look ""happy."" There were no significant hallucinations at first, just colorful darkness when they closed their eyes. They took another small hit and then smoked what was left in the bag, but this did not significantly enhance the experience.

The participant sat back on the bed and began to see their room as a different level of some past life. They thought deeply about previous trips and an old forgotten night. The trip brought back memories from a previous high-level experience where they had hallucinated another world in front of them, though they were unaware of it at the time.

The participant felt a sense of spiritual and mental blissfulness, with an urge to increase the music volume. They perceived the world as bent and felt enlightened by the experience. The trip taught them about their past experiences and left them feeling calm and reflective."
1586,36313,"The participant experienced intense visual distortions after consuming two and a half hits of an unnamed substance.

1588,99393,"The individual smoked a bowl containing both salvia and marijuana. After several attempts to clear the bowl, they experienced an altered state of consciousness characterized by visual distortions. They perceived their surroundings as if looking down upon a puzzle with moving pieces, which eventually resolved into recognizing that they were seeing inside their own house. The participant appeared peaceful and joyful during this experience, according to their friends."
1589,70995,"The participant consumed a small amount of a substance for the first time, smoking approximately one gram total in two hits. Initially, they felt dizzy and described it as similar to nitrous oxide effects. This sensation lasted around five minutes and then transformed into a short-lived thumping headache. The experience did not last long, leading the participant to decide that this was not something they enjoyed."
1590,67078,The participant consumed a substance by adding half a gram to their daily tea. They reported feeling very relaxed and happy for approximately 24 hours following consumption.
1591,46430,"The participant experienced a sense of movement between rooms in their apartment after consuming the substance. They picked up a guitar and struck it violently before closing their eyes and entering a state of delirium. The primary visual experience involved repetitive images of climbing out of the ground on what appeared to be a giant plane or field, which was described as being akin to the participant's own head. This imagery continued indefinitely."
1592,52731,"The participant consumed an unspecified substance and immediately felt a sudden rush followed by their body freezing up and a stinging sensation in their skin. Their vision blurred, making it difficult to focus on tasks such as using the computer. They walked carefully upstairs but did not feel particularly paranoid, instead experiencing apathy. The parents came home during the experience and monitored the participant's behavior. After returning to their room, the effects wore off quickly, leaving an eerie feeling."
1593,56474,"The participant began by consuming an unspecified substance with three friends in a wooded area. Within ten seconds, they experienced intense visual and auditory distortions, including repeating images and sounds that lasted approximately twenty seconds.

After returning to normal consciousness, the participant was irritated for about half an hour before settling down."
1594,19756,"The individual began by inhaling a significant dose of an unnamed substance through a gravity bong. Immediately after inhalation, they experienced visual distortions where their hands appeared to glow and move away from them. The room seemed to spin in multiple directions, creating a disorienting sensation similar to being inside a ball rolling on a flat surface.

The participant then entered a state of intense mental imagery, experiencing layers of spiraling colors and shapes that enveloped their vision. These visual elements were accompanied by repetitive auditory hallucinations, with millions of people appearing as colorful entities repeating the same mantra-like sound directed at them. The experience was described as overwhelming and queasy-inducing.

Attempts to interact with the physical environment, such as brushing teeth or moving through the house, became challenging due to the persistent visual and mental distortions. The individual found themselves repeatedly performing actions without clear awareness of whether they had already completed them.

As time passed, the intensity of the experience gradually diminished, though new aspects emerged, like changes in the speed and tone of the auditory hallucinations. Eventually, the participant was able to sleep, with the effects continuing to subside throughout the night.

The account also mentions a friend (""N"") who had a different experience, describing feeling like a particle on a beach being washed away, though ""N"" quickly calmed down after the initial intense phase."

Initially, there were no significant effects beyond lightheadedness and slight dizziness. However, after several hits, intense visual distortions began. The individual saw a bush outside their window transform into a dolphin in their front yard. Upon attempting to interact with the dolphin by slapping themselves or blinking, it disappeared. After this point, the participant's memory becomes unclear."
1596,27627,"The participant inhaled two hits of a substance and experienced intense visual distortions and physical sensations. They saw the TV screen dripping rhythmically with their heartbeat and felt their heart pounding violently throughout their body. In panic over what they perceived as a potential heart attack, the participant ran downstairs and outside, feeling like they were flying through an unfamiliar realm. After lying down on concrete, their heart returned to normal, leading to a realization about life being a dream. During the comedown phase, which lasted for two hours, the participant had difficulty understanding language and perceiving their friends' faces as they morphed and melted."
1597,27391,"The participant, aged 57 with extensive experience in altered states, smoked an extract of a substance twice under quiet conditions with a friend present. Both times, the experience was described as extremely negative and perceived as ""ancient malevolent evil"" or ""hell."" The individual did not encounter any specific entities but felt a pervasive sense of dread and negativity throughout both experiences."
1598,7498,"The participant smoked an unknown substance through a trumpet mouthpiece while sitting on their patio. Within a minute of smoking, they experienced a strong head rush. They perceived all objects as having human-like spirits and had involuntary telepathic conversations with inanimate objects, such as a window. The experience shifted from positive to negative when the participant attempted several tasks instead of yielding to the altered state. This led to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anger. The participant then wrapped themselves in a blanket and lay down in the den, eventually dozing off."
1599,9144,"The participant began by smoking a substance and felt mild illness without significant effects. After consuming absinthe, they experienced a strange, colorful vision but no euphoria. Forty minutes later, they drank Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Tea and smoked hash. Twenty minutes after drinking the tea, their body became heavy and nauseous, and they felt panicky. Over the next two hours, they dosed in and out of sleep, feeling tired and sick with no visual disturbances when closing their eyes. Their body felt weak and uncoordinated for three more hours before the nausea subsided and control was regained. They smoked hash to calm down and returned to reality six hours after consuming the tea."
1600,6948,"The individual was at home alone when they began their experience. They stood in the kitchen and took a large hit of an extract, which caused a tight feeling behind their ears and a spinning sensation into what they described as ""Salvia space."" The room elongated, and there were visual distortions that made it appear like an outside thatched hut with rapidly distorting space and a thatched ceiling. A left-sided barrier forced the individual to move to the right.

The edges of the visual field narrowed, creating an eye-shaped space. One of their cats approached, walking on what appeared to be a curved floor before vanishing into the horizon 15 feet away. The carpet colors became more vivid and distracting. Gradually, the thatched ceiling solidified, and the surroundings returned to normal.

The experience lasted approximately 14 minutes, followed by a glow for an additional 30 minutes."
1601,13697,"The participant was approached by a police officer while sitting in a graveyard. The officer asked to search their satchel, which contained multiple bags of a substance and a bong. Upon inspection, the officer appeared visibly disturbed. Backup arrived, with five additional cop cars coming onto the scene. After examining the contents, the officers concluded it was not marijuana based on its smell and appearance. When questioned by the original officer about their intentions, the participant responded that they were starting a business to provide a legal high for those who couldn't risk an illegal one. The officer then allowed the participant to leave with their belongings."
1602,6022,"The participant took an unnamed substance for the first time, feeling strange but still able to think clearly. They lay down in bed and closed their eyes, experiencing a sensation of being pulled upward into a vortex. At the corners of their mind, they perceived geometrical shapes resembling flowers with spiraling patterns that were not fully visible but perceptible. The participant felt as though they could choose to depart from reality into another world but was hindered by physical distractions such as cold room temperature and sounds from other rooms."
1603,5108,"The participant experienced a profound alteration of perception, beginning with a sensation of their back swelling as if carrying the future of others. They felt their mind acting as a roadmap to a gathering place where chaotic elements were held together. The world around them was described as molten and filled with subtextual longings between planets.

Entities perceived included beings that unmasked human nature as clumsy, multi-complex mucus membrane socializing apparatuses. These entities engaged in interactions that revealed the participant's understanding of their existence on another plane. 

The experience also involved visual phenomena such as spiral galaxies floating by and an island where language was born. The participant felt their mind splitting like an atom when worlds merged, experiencing oscillations between different states of being (man, ape, microorganism). They described a sensation of floating away in a mess of words with their entire sentence sedated."
1604,9769,"The participant purchased an unknown substance from a stall at a cannabis march and consumed it in one hit. Immediately after consumption, they felt disoriented and experienced time distortion, with everything seeming like a blur. They began walking aimlessly without knowing why or where they were going. During the peak of the experience, which lasted about ten minutes according to their friend, the participant reported shrinking into a small yellow blob. The intensity was described as more intense than previous experiences with other substances such as pills, acid, ketamine, mescaline, and DMT. A sober companion was present throughout the experience."
1605,4748,"Four individuals gathered at home with the intention of using an unnamed substance. They took approximately 20 bong hits in total but did not experience any noticeable effects.

The group concluded that the substance was ineffective for them."

1608,880,"The individual reported feeling like multiple people simultaneously during the experience. One self was playing guitar, another was observing, and a third was narrating the event. The arms felt alien and disconnected from the rest of the body. Time perception was altered, allowing anticipation of musical notes before they were played. The combination of substances led to a state of selflessness and timelessness, which lasted for about an hour and a half. After this period, the individual and their friend listened to music by Olivia Tremor Control, during which the living room appeared animated."
1609,898,"The participant and a friend ingested an unknown substance through three deep inhalations each from a pipe.
